I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I will buy my entire one on line. The quality is great, just the right amount. It's not too thick and doesn't slide off your wrist when you're sitting. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes great products. Just note that this is a very poor quality garment.",19.856006622314453,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"This thing is that it's made out of a plastic plastic, stiff, like flannel and the threads are tearing. There are seams hanging out all over the place where they should be sewn on, and the sleeves are sewn in an odd shape. The sleeves aren't even sewn on well, and the quality is lacking. For $11, I don't think this would have happened.",12.631144523620605,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"After one use, the jacket is a little short. It's great to hang around but it's a good sleeve length which does not stay in place. Would definitely buy more of these. Highly recommend for the office!I would recommend. I'll give it 5 stars as it's adorable.",25.269027709960938,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"We are the RIPPING. We bought this for our 2 year old to go back to school. I wanted it to be more loose, but not so much. The material is very thin and not soft and very thin, although a 2 year old's bathrobe is very soft on one end, he has to tuck the lanyard on. We have a feeling this top would be helpful for a child to wear when he starts his arms, which I was not happy. It doesn't keep my son warm for longer than some, especially since the fabric was thin and he just kept cold weather all day, and it was very warm. I recommend this seller.",19.15029525756836,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"The shirt is absolutely adorable. It's not too much of a cosplay shirt, but it's a great quality and fits great. I wish I could choose from these companies. They are a great buy. The quality is really great. I'd definitely buy again.I've really liked the way they look.",12.928614616394043,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I like this product as I'm going to be looking for something that will hold up to washing so no shrinking or pulling up. I actually received it in my closet and was so excited to get it. It is so cute and fit well. I am 5'7"" and the medium was too tight as well, which is a small in this brand.",15.327507019042969,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I love how warm it is. The material is soft and it fits perfectly. It's very flowy, but I'm hoping for the right drape. I purchased a Medium and am satisfied with my purchase. I received tons of compliments on this sweater by friends and family. I highly recommend it to anyone!",11.155033111572266,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"It fits as expected and I really liked this dress. The material was very nice. It didn't cost much to just look at the dress. This one is quite well made. It is thin but not see through at all. So I'm going to return it, and will see what happens.",10.89754867553711,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I can wear it while riding my dog. You cannot see out of it, if I didn't. If I had one of those two layers I would say they would love it. I ordered a large and it was way too large for my son. There was no sizing so I would have to give it to my son. I will order again in a larger size. I've also been disappointed by the company for this shirt. I think the quality is nice but they should have been made in China.",13.328988075256348,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"First, I love the style of the shirt. I'm 5'2"", 220 pounds, and wear a 34B chest. I ordered a Medium and it was super tight, but not fitted correctly. I would say size down? I probably could have ordered the Medium. However, the material was kind of weird (there's a stitch to the side of the shirt) but I did not like it. Very disappointed in the design. It felt uncomfortable.",10.830042839050293,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I was going to try it but I was going to let it know that it runs small. I found that it was 3/4 inches too long and the sleeves were to long. I ordered the same size with the arms and sleeves as well. If not, I'll keep it and find that there are something to hold up at the hips. I could not even wear this. It was too tight on my frame and too long. I ordered a M in a regular T-shirt shirt which looks great under a T-shirt but would not recommend to anyone in a smaller size.",12.636397361755371,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I bought this dress as a flannel dress. The dress was thin but stretched to a good length. The material is really thin. The lace is thin and see through. Overall, I'm happy with it. It isn't worth $20 but I probably wont be able to wear the dress.",11.4734525680542,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I ordered this in a size large to make sure to wear it in public without issue. It's way too small and I can't even get it in. You must say I received a large, and I'm a size 14, so I have to order something that could have fit me properly without the issue. The fabric is very stiff and is very soft and soft, so if you're not a tight fan of your body type, or don't this item.",12.388952255249023,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"The large size fit perfectly, however, once you get the Large, they just don't fit. So as an XL I figured it would fit better, but with the very large, it was way too big in the shoulders. I'm 5'8"" and it hit me in the middle of my mid-back. It hits right above my ankle and looks great with my white leggings.",13.997651100158691,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,This shirt is perfect. I wear it to work and this fits really well. I was so happy that the jacket was not a big deal. I do not have to pull up a belt for more comfort. My boyfriend loves this sweater. This vest is awesome and he wears it all day.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"This is not it. It's a T-shirt that fits my 5'5"" frame slightly larger than expected (the only reason I ordered 2T). It looks nice and comfy, I am happy that I purchased it, especially for the price. It will serve the purpose of buying it. It arrived much sooner than the other estimated delivery date.",13.765989303588867,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"The size XL was just a tad big for my liking, but with the product it was a bit big in the bust and I was too uncomfortable in the chest. The fabric was also a bit see through. Not exactly what I was looking for but returned it because it has some of the wrong color in it. The only reason why I didn't return it is because the cut of the shirt is not flattering at all and that is why it is about the top.",13.051548957824707,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I was extremely pleased with the color, and the fabric, however, there are a bit of stretch in the fabric and the cut is too high. I ordered a Medium. It fit great, but I wish there was a way more fitted fabric. The outer part is very loose and if it is less tight fitting, it makes it not a problem for me. The lace was a little too thick and seemed a bit see-through. Unfortunately I returned it, the cost I was expecting a jersey to be more comfortable and had time to reorder. I am not sure if I will keep it or not just wear it around the house.",10.914377212524414,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I am very pleased with my purchase! This is a fantastic deal for the money. I ordered two. One for my mom. The two piece broke within a week and the replacement was no longer secure. If the quality of this coat is better I would of recommend this shirt. I plan to order more when necessary purchases this one.Update: After ordering these twice was more than expected and I did order from them again. They also look really good, quality and stitching, etc. I had no problems with this company, no, no one has the seam in the front, and zipper already came loose. It is a very beautiful skirt! I am so sad this company is based on reviews.",16.518360137939453,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I'm a bit surprised at how this shirt looks when I first opened the package. As I put it on I was shocked to see the neckline. It looks amazing. But the material is very thin and clingy. I'm not a very big chested person and the fit is snug. I gave it two stars because it fits great and isn't flattering at all. But I'm going to buy more colors.,8.129403114318848,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"After reading reviews I was pleased and decided to try it. The fabric is soft and comfortable. The colors were true and the fit was as I expected. I ordered it in a size medium (I’m 5’3”, 155 lbs. It fits nice and is stretchy but very light and comfortable. I would definitely recommend sizing down a size if you want this fitted fit.",10.023856163024902,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I'm so pleased!First time I bought this shirt. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and comfort of the fabric.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"After one day use it's almost impossible to take it off. This shirt has more comfortable than a shirt. I love the color.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"In my opinion, you can totally tell that this sweater was from China. The description says it is a hooded and a hoodie. So, it's just horrible. It's a thin, stretchy polyester and scratchy, and super lightweight. I don't have this hoodie in other colors, but it's not. The fit is true to size. I ordered one in a different color. I'm disappointed. It's awful.",9.667670249938965,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I purchased in a 2XL. They are wayyyy to small, I don't know why. It is the wrong size or it is so large that it's like a Xl,I can't return it, but I had to pay shipping for it to China. They sent a 2X, and they said that it was a Medium but it's not even a medium.I hate giving it only one star because of the design and sizing.",11.257867813110352,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"It's very good. The fabric is thin, soft, and is extremely lightweight, and while the construction of the sweater is good, so I will probably find it very nice to wear when I stand the house. (If you buy, consider ordering a size smaller than you normally wear), I did get the XXL because I don't like the riding/stuffs a lot. I would've gone with a size down, and they don't quite fit. The sleeves are a little short, and the fabric isn't too wide and the collar hangs awkwardly, but it has absolutely no shape, which is nice. The seams on the sides are crooked and make the shirt look a little strange (I'm not too crazy). It's comfortable to wear, but I doubt the shirt looks great.",12.283500671386719,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"First of all, I'm a very happy customer. It was a little big for my head. I ordered a size larger than I expected.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,This is by far the most unique one I have seen. They are super soft and comfortable. It's hard to find out of this shirt online. It's a bit tight at the chest (which is not exactly what I wanted). I'm going to order more in more colors! My only complaint is that the length is short. So I may have to wear heels with it but I can't wear it in public. Overall I like the look and feel of this style and it is very flattering. Highly recommend.,9.4451265335083,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"It arrived with two ties (to protect the neck) but I was really disappointed that the material was extremely thin, like scratchy and definitely need a little cotton to get worn to the touch of my nose for a few hours to get a rash. Unfortunately, since I did return it and will be purchasing another color because I really liked the color. I might reorder a different type because of material and style. But, my hair got stuck and I couldn't get it to stay where I want to get it out. I'm 5'11 150 lbs and bought the XL, which should have fit perfectly.",13.297565460205078,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I am a bit disappointed. I have been looking for a nice weight tote for my clothes to carry on bare arms for more than a year. This sweater still does the job and it really is exactly as advertised and has a good amount of space and is thick enough to make you look good in a cooler night. My biggest complaint is that the color is a lighter red than the pictures and the material looks almost a bit heavier than the image. The material is more light in summer heat and I can easily see it through a light thermal shirt underneath so I would highly say that it is not as warm but I will probably end up wearing it.,12.284994125366211,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I was very surprised, by the look and color (as shown). However, it is VERY clingy so if you order at least a size or two too big. Unfortunately, it was too big and looked a bit awkward on me, especially around my chest. I had no choice to size up, but it was just a very unflattering dress.I'm keeping it since I'm not returning it for the medium size and I'm going to send it back.",11.743783950805664,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I absolutely love this tank! It's soft, comfortable, and has pockets and it covers my butt. Love the different one. I am 5ft6 so the size medium is perfect! So, I am getting the L (I have a L in black) and it's not tight. I haven't washed it yet but its wearable and it will go with any leggings or some leggings.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"The fabric is soft and cool, and I love the design on the back that I don't need. The front front/back back of the shirt is a great fabric and the back is removable. But the neckline is too wide and doesn't fit properly.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I am 5'9"" and weigh a size 14, but with a longer torso it was too snug. I had to return it because it is VERY long, and the color was a tad too off and was still snug. I would definitely size up if you like this style. The coat didn't have any stretch, and was definitely not stretchy. I was disappointed to find a nice thick soft hoodie with long sleeves.",12.996411323547363,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"The material is soft, and it's a great find. It has 2 layers, and they have just the right amount of material. I love it. I'm so sad that this shirt is so soft, which I don't expect too much to love for such a comfortable fit. The top fits perfectly though. It's a little big as for my size. I've been carrying it in my bag since I'm an Asian woman in a shopping man. I also like the material. And the bottom quality is unique.",15.280736923217773,12.965813430595398

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"There's a few things about this shirt in the description and I will just pay for it to last. The material is soft and the fit is just right. I wear a 34C and I ordered the size Large. The top fit perfectly, I am usually a L or XS. I got the XL, the neckline is not even close to being a XXL. I wear it as a tight shirt with a slightly loose fit, and it looks good with some tight sleeves. It's also slightly heavy. But for me it's ok for when the weather is below. I like the fabric and the embroidery, so I'm very pleased with this shirt. If you're planning to buy another color, get one of my ""black"" shirts.",12.510295867919922,12.965813430595398

I usually go one size bigger than normal. I'm 5'4"", 160 lbs. and I purchased Medium. It fit well, is a little loose, but doesn't look exactly like a belly shirt.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I was happy to see that I ordered a size larger than my usual size based on the other reviews. I ordered the XL (I'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs) and I think it was a tad snug (I think it would have been my usual size.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality shirt that is comfortable for a cold weather sweater. It feels good too! The sleeves on the arm are a little too long for a longer person and that's how I wanted the sleeves.Overall, a cute and warm jacket. I am happy with this purchase.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I was going to buy the same exact shirt in black as shown in the photo. I think if you are looking for something to wear as a top that you will look good with leggings and blazer. This was NOT the color that I expected. I purchased a size up. This was more like a small.

This brand is not made for a human in my size and even though I read the reviews I decided to order the correct size from what it said. It definitely didn't fit right in this photo. When I got the shirt, it was WAY too small. Very thin. The picture looks very deceiving. But I like that it fit just okay. Fabric is very thin and you can see everything underneath. Oh, it is cute but if you look closely. If you are not going to look like your pictures, then pass them on a hanger. So if you are looking for something a little less fitted I probably give them to.

I think it is really comfortable and warm, which is a plus. I am a curvy size 12/14 and I purchased this in an XXL. I was not satisfied by the quality.

I think it may look okay in others but I doubt the length will be good.",13.340195655822754,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I have worn it while working out since I can't have any issues. It's very very stretchy, and very comfortable. Love the open back zipper. You won't want to wear a bra with a push up.The sleeves are a tad long but that's not a problem. I can't even sleep with it. I really like the jacket, and the price, too. My phone fits a tad wide, so if it's tight, I'd size up. I'm a 40.5 and I bought the size Large, and I'm a 34DD. The XL would also fit me perfectly. The hood is snug and not too tight. It's an adorable way.",10.996206283569336,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I'll be ordering from this site again. It is a nice thick fabric, thick but I hate wearing it. I am usually a medium and this shirt was way too large. I even followed the sizing guide and was afraid to wash it, let my dry on delicate because it shrank a bit so much that it's been a XXL and it's tight on me. Not enough space for a smaller size unless I want to put a M.",11.911269187927246,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,This shirt is extremely lightweight and flattering! I was worried the top would be too long and it is exactly what I wanted and I could fit into it with a belt (I'm a small/medium) but my husband is a size 5. I'm happy with the pants and vest. The sleeves are a bit short for my 6 month old but it is perfect for her to wear as a dress.,11.211368560791016,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I don't know if it is as high as in the pictures. But, the quality is so poor it's trash. I can tell that this sweater is from overseas. I am afraid to wear this again. I bought it to wear as a costume and was not going out. The fabric is a very stiff and thick.The fit is perfect, the t-shirt fabric is comfortable and the color is bright. I'm 5'6"" and weigh about 200. It's also long in the back. Not sure how long you'll be in this thing. I only wore once to get to work, so I don't recommend.",11.235097885131836,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I always wear it every day but with a lot of my family and night it's great.

I will buy again in the future.,12.436846733093262,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I ordered the pink and it actually looks nothing like the picture. It was a light and soft material that looked like cotton. Not what I expected for the price. Returned and ordered a different color. There is no label on it. I'll just have to contact the seller if they make the right colors but they just weren't what was pictured. Very cheaply made, not made for anyone. Save your money and order it. It's worth it. Just buy something you'd wear for a casual, casual or evening wear around the house.",12.128349304199219,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I should say it's true red color, but my husband is a huge L-XL so I figured I'd have to buy one in a few more of my usual t-shirts, but this one fits like a M/L. In this case, the arm holes are a tad tight across the arms and the arms, but not that big. So overall this shirt is well made and will last for a warm winter look.",13.566944122314453,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I was so happy with the quality for the price and workmanship. It is very stretchy and comfortable. The fit is snug but can be deceiving if you are large chested. I am a 40DD and wanted it to be loose fitting but that worked best for me and I'm glad I purchased the XL.,10.408978462219238,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"It's not as soft as I had hoped. The picture online did not help me from actually wearing it without a cowl bra, which has a real bummer. But, the color doesn't match the red in the photo at all. The bright red is not bright, more of a dull. It's not a soft material, the v neckline is great for the hot summer. But for $5, maybe better for quality leather.",14.061509132385254,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I like it. It's a nice fit but is very tight around my chest and arms. I can't imagine that size would be accurate but the sleeves would be tight. Also the elastic is adjustable on the neck area making it look like your carrying in the stores. I would advise buying this item to you need the T-shirt to fit into the shoulders.,21.231075286865234,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I like that this t-shirt has a soft lining and it is breathable. The color is a great match! The material is thick and breathable so you may need a cami. The quality of the material is extremely good and the price is great. I ordered a black one and it is not too see-through.I was very happy with my purchase. It arrived in a timely manner. It's a great quality t-shirt! I will definitely be ordering more of this brand.,8.818558692932129,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"This shirt is super cute, well made and appears to be quality. The sizing is a little different than I was expecting, but that's okay. It's actually pretty comfortable for warm weather, but not to wear in hot weather as it's pretty hot. The red is actually more of a cream color. It has no green or turquoise. The fabric is thicker than expected. I just decided I just size up based on reviews. It fit perfect, is not too tight or snug. The quality of the fabric and the way it looks. The cut of the shirt is just adorable and I've worn it many times and so far LOVE IT! I will be ordering other colors and patterns.",10.77778148651123,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I didn't know it's only about the back side or back. I don't like the feel of the material. The fabric is too shiny.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,This shirt is exactly what I was looking for. I'm a 34C and this shirt would be great on the thinner side. The colors are vibrant. There are also 3 small holes in the sleeve that make it a lot shorter than I would like for.The product itself is good quality and I would definitely recommend these!,11.99197769165039,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I have several different hats. This one is my favorite. It fits me a little big so I have two of the three.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I thought it would be a bit more vibrant red-ish but it is a bright color. It fits perfectly, it's not tight or too long, but not to the point of looking like a dress. Very pleased. Highly recommend. I bought one in each color. I love it.Update: After a few weeks of wearing the material it began to get caught on the collar. This company sent a replacement card which they sent to me, but I noticed that I was just going to wear. So, this product is a new problem for me.",12.932168960571289,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I think this shirt is by far the best quality and extremely soft. This shirt is comfortable and the colors are fantastic. It fits me perfectly. I have a longer torso and is quite comfortable. The shirt is a little longer than the front. I can wear the top with or even a shaper shirt and if the sleeves are a little bit longer I like that. This shirt is the cutest thing to my wardrobe. I will likely order more in the future.,9.757889747619629,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I wear it inside of the wind because the weather comes out quickly. It's a bit big, but it works for those that need to be worn during the winter. Very breathable material. I do find it a little thicker for my taste to work. But this is very cute and comfortable. You can't beat the price!",19.61279296875,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I always order a large so I have to order down a size. The large fits perfectly. The material is soft and warm. It's very comfortable and you can't wear it around the house or with anything in it. I love the soft material also. The price was extremely fast and when I went to get it there is no wrinkled or wrinkles. I would definitely recommend this shirt to anyone.,8.710761070251465,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I am very happy. It fits just as I expected. But if you are looking for a thick cotton t-shirt, this will look like you wear a regular t-shirt. It's pretty thin so not hot. It's not soft. The collar of the sleeve is just a kind of waffle neck t-shirt knit blend fabric with a regular t-shirt that actually has a stiff, so it will get too hot. I really wanted to like it. It doesn't make me like I'm wearing a bathrobe. It's very very comfortable too.",11.263882637023926,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I ordered this in the black and loved it so much I wanted a clean look. I'm 5'1"" and about 130 lbs so the small fits me like a glove and I got the Medium, so I was satisfied. I loved that it shipped when I was initially being able to wear it. I'll probably order more for sure. I do have trouble with the company, I didn't know that the product came from China.",11.6108980178833,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"This is a nice jacket. First off it is thin, a little more stiff, but I like that it has a soft lining (that I don't really care for fleece), and the fleece-like fleece is really soft, the inside is much warm and comfortable. So I returned it for a larger size. It was very clingy but also a very tight fit. I could only get it altered for the size I needed and had to keep it. But as others have said, I ordered it twice over a year. You could not have this problem with any other t-shirt on it. Not what I was hoping for but there is lots of loose threads all over. I do not like it just disappointed in the fabric.",12.733288764953613,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"First of all, the fabric was very scratchy, and although the color was vibrant, it's not as nice of a vibrant pink as pictured. It's about the same as other t-shirt fabric shirts from a different seller. Not worth the money. I purchased the 2xl and it is a bit snug and a little snug around the stomach/neck area. I have two other t-shirts from this brand so they fit just right. I bought this as a work shirt that would fit the arms and it fits a little loose.Overall very satisfied with this purchase.",11.900256156921387,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I have received many compliments on this suit. I am 5'1 and ordered a medium. Fits me perfectly! The fabric is soft, stretchy and easy to adjust for the cool summer. The material is soft and comfortable. It is not tight at all. The suit fits just as expected, the waist is just right and the top sits about an inch or below my belly button. If you want to have an additional band, I like the feel of the fabric and the fact that you can adjust the girls. It's a great buy, you won't be disappointed, but definitely more of a quality suit.",8.626242637634277,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"I love that it's soft and warm. My only complaint is that after 3 washes they start to unravel down the back of the shirt.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"This coat is the best. I love how light it is. It's soft and comfortable.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,The material is thick and soft and looks great. It fits me perfectly. I got several compliments when I wore it.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"This T-shirt fits exactly as I needed. The material is soft and silky- It's very light. The print is nice and it does run true to size. I am 5'9"" 130 lbs and ordered an XXL. The sleeve length and length are great for me, with heels, and heels. The shoulders are slightly snug but still roomy enough to pull the straps up. I don't mind that, if you have a small, short torso then I think will be able to get away with this jacket. I would recommend this product to someone looking to add a good sized handbag, I will be ordering a few more in different patterns.",9.07585334777832,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,I'm not a huge fan of the material. The shirt is very thin and has a very stretchy material. It also runs large and is not very comfortable. You can also make it right for your work or going to box up. I ordered the XL and it is very short. It's a cute design. It is a bit longer than I like. I am a very tall girl so I am returning this one. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because it says 100% cotton. They are 100% polyester and the fit is perfect! I wanted to keep it for work.,8.792400360107422,12.965813430595398
I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,The sizing runs very small. I ordered XXL. I wear a 10 and I think they run smaller.

I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.,"This shirt was the most comfortable brand- which I didn't expect. It was much easier to find when I'm out in a cold town or just running in the woods, so I decided to buy some more and try them. The quality appears to be low, so you definitely need to get it tailored, and that was the only positive thing to find that I would suggest taking it with it.

I thought this would be warm for cold weather but when I got wet the jacket it was incredibly tight, and the arms are about too long. I ordered a size up and it fit great. So I wanted a loose fit. It felt like a good material, but I can't imagine myself wearing it without something else. Just be careful about that.

The jacket was not large enough and it just slid down too close when I wanted it to look cool. The color of the jacket itself is also a bright blue not exactly the bright orange as pictured. The actual jacket is a pretty color and the quality is great, for the price, it's pretty good. The picture online shows how it's printed. There is no belt included in the front, so this isn't a match. There is no inside pockets for this. So I would recommend this product to anyone.",10.474584579467773,12.965813430595398
