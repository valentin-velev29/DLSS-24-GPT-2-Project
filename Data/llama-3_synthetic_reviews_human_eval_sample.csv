This is a very important question to ask yourself when it comes to reviews. The answer may surprise you. While it is generally true that positive reviews are more trustworthy than negative reviews, this is not always the case. Here's why: When you read a negative review, you are more likely to trust the reviewer's opinion because they have something to gain by giving a bad review. On the other hand, when you read a positive review, you are more likely to trust the reviewer's opinion because they have nothing to gain by giving a good review. In other words, negative reviews are more likely to be biased, while positive reviews are more likely to be unbiased. This is not to say that all positive reviews are trustworthy,",2.8354263305664062,3.342459103167057
