Both reviews are about the same shirt. It's a T-shirt. There is nothing special about it. But the reviews are special because they're written by people who want to sell the shirt. They're not objective reviews. They're sales pitches.
In the world of online reviews, it's easy to find glowing reviews for products that don't live up to the hype. This is because people are more likely to write reviews when they're happy with a product, and they're more likely to write positive reviews when they're trying to sell something.
This is why it's important to read reviews with a critical eye. Just because someone says they love a product doesn't mean it's worth buying. Be skeptical of reviews that are overly positive or don't provide any details. And always do your own research before making a purchase.
