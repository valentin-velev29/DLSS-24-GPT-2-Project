I bought this shirt to wear to the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida.  I thought it would be a great way to make a statement about the Republican Party’s position on immigration.  The shirt was a little bit more expensive than I expected, but I thought it would be worth it to support the cause.

"10th Anniversary T-Shirt (2011)
From the first time I set eyes on the T-shirt, I was hooked. I simply couldn’t help myself. It had to be the “Vengeance Shirt”.
The t-shirt was sold in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the show. The shirt had a very similar pattern to the t-shirt worn by Shao Kahn (at least, the one worn by Mortal Kombat character artist Jon Burton) in the Mortal Kombat II intro. However, unlike the original Shao Kahn design, the 10th anniversary design is primarily red, with white and black accents. The shirt is also much more detailed, featuring various “"

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend T-Shirt
My friend and I were talking a few weeks ago about how we didn’t like our hair.  I said that we should get crazy haircuts, like pixie cuts.
So I got my pixie cut.  It’s a dramatic change.  One that I was very nervous about making, but I am so glad that I did.
I did get a few compliments, but mostly people stared at me for a few seconds."
"“Just a Guy Who Happens to Play for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.""  The design and printing was done by The Shirt Shop.
Here is the Shirt Shop's write up of the shirt:
The Shirt Shop has done several t-shirts for the Angels in the past.  We have always been fans of their work, so we were glad that they were willing to do this one as well.  The only change we suggested that we wanted was for them to use a black rather than red trim for the Angels logo.  
This is an awesome design from Shirt Shop and the execution was excellent.  The t-shirt is a quality shirt that fits well"
"12-3-74. This was a show that I attended 10 years after the fact. I will not go into the details of the show because there are plenty of reviews of this tour online. I bought this t-shirt in November of 1984 after seeing The Who on the 4th of November tour. We had to travel all night to get there and got there just in time for the show.
The shirt is all black with the show date and venue. It is a very basic t-shirt so I don't really have much to say about it. There are a couple of things that make this shirt special. One was that the concert was held in the Houston Astrod"

"5.8.8.8.8.8.
We were in the mood for some old school punk rock, so we started listening to our favourite punk albums. We didn’t want to go too far into nostalgia and were happy to find a song that is relevant to the current times.
You know when you get the chance to go back to an earlier time in your life, when you feel like that you can still be the same person, but you can’t quite remember the details? This is what happens to some people. They may have a vague idea of who they were, but they feel like they haven’t been able to recreate that person.

"50 Shades of Geek from the guys at ThinkGeek. This is a review of the product, not the book, though I have read the book.
In my opinion the “50 shades” of this t-shirt are a very geeky bunch. I can’t think of a single one that is really applicable to my life, though I did try. I couldn’t think of any shades that would fit me, so I am not likely to buy this t-shirt. I do like the shirt, and I do like the design, but I just can’t think of a single shade that applies to me. That’s not to say that there aren’t a few that I could relate to."

The golf swing, and how we play the game, has changed a lot over the years.  We used to play the game with just a ball, a club and a flag.  Today we have a lot more, and I have to say the game is much more enjoyable.  It is not that we have changed that much, it is just that we are able to use technology to play the game in a different manner.

"2nd Amendment: It’s a God Given Right! It is from the company: T-Shirt Supreme. It is not a paid review.
If you haven’t seen this shirt, it’s definitely worth checking out. The second amendment is definitely a God given right. It is one of the first things you learn in government class. I’m not sure where the “God” part comes from, but it is a valid statement. The only reason I’m saying this is because I’ve never heard of a T-Shirt Supreme shirt before. I’m not sure if it’s just a coincidence that the same company that sells shirts with the name “God” is also the one that makes this shirt."
