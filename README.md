# **Replication material and Appendix for the paper "Synthetic Product Review Generation for Market Analysis: A GPT-2 and LLaMA 3 Approach"**
**Description:** This repository contains the replication materials and the Appendix for our final project for the course "Deep Learning for the Social Sciences" (SuSe 2024) at the University of Konstanz.

**Authors:** George-Lembach, Carl, Klotz, Tom, Schleißheimer, Julia, and Velev, Valentin

## Appendix
The Appendix for our paper is available in the file [appendix.pdf]().

## Fine-Tuned GPT-2 Medium
Our fine-tuned GPT-2 Medium model is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/TomData/GPT2-review).

Nore that since we used PyTorch to fine-tune GPT-2 Medium, the Inference API on Hugging Face does not work.

## Data
In the folder [Data](https://github.com/valentin-velev29/DLSS-24-Project-Replication-Material/tree/main/Data), we have made available our main datasets. The remaining datasets are available on [Synology Cloud](https://T34278926.quickconnect.to/d/s/ziemTGVVHGhyI6UHtWm7P9qA4fkL730m/d_yA3FB3AKlZC2PuJi0EphdTXlMTogjB-K7Ug0fCgmws ). Below you will find a brief overview of all the data files:

* [preprocessed_reviews.csv](): Contains our preprocessed data with 100,000 Amazon fashion item reviews
* [topic_modeling_results.csv](): Contains the results of BERTopic on the 100,000 Amazon product reviews
* [gpt-2_synthetic_reviews.csv](): Contains the sample of 10,000 synthetic product reviews generated by our fine-tuned GPT-2 Medium and the perplexity scores for each synthetic product review
* [gpt-2_synthetic_reviews_human_eval_sample.csv](): Contains a random sample of 100 synthetic product reviews generated by our fine-tuned GPT-2 Medium for human evaluation and the perplexity scores for each synthetic product review
* [gpt-2_tested_prompts.csv](): Contains 
* [llama-3_synthetic_reviews.csv](): Contains the sample of 10,000 synthetic product reviews generated by Llama 3 8B and the perplexity scores for each synthetic product review
* [llama-3_synthetic_reviews_human_eval_sample.csv](): Contains a random sample of 100 synthetic product reviews generated by our fine-tuned GPT-2 Medium for human evaluation and the perplexity scores for each synthetic product review
* [llama-3_tested_prompts.csv](): ...
* [human_evaluation.xlsx](): Contains the results from our human evaluation (see our paper for more information)
* [market_analysis.xlsx](): Contains the results from our market analysis (see our paper for more information)

## Notebooks
The Jupyter Notebooks we used for all our computation, analysis, and visualization are in the main branch and in the folders [Classification]() and [Synthetic Product Review Generation and Analysis](). Below you will find a brief overview of the Jupyter Notebooks:

Main branch:
* [ETL.ipynb](): Notebook for data preprocessing / extract-transform-load (ETL) pipeline including:
  * Data cleaning
  * ...
  * ...
* [EDA.ipynb](): Notbook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) including:
  * Average length of reviews and standard deviation of review length
  * Histogram of review length distribution
  * Rating distribution (overall and by sentiment)
  * Word clouds (overall, by sentiment, and by rating)
  * Topic modeling using BERTopic

Classification:
* [sentiment.ipynb](): Notebook for classifying the Amazon fashion item reviews to randomly sample by sentiment using SiEBERT (see paper for more information)
* [topic_modeling.ipynb](): Notebook for topic modelling using BERTopic

Synthetic Review Generation and Analysis:
* [gpt-2_fine-tune.ipynb](): Notebook for fine-tuning GPT-2. Note that the fine-tuning with 100,000 reviews takes roughly 2-3 days using two NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB).
* [gpt-2_review_generation.ipynb](): Notebook for generating synthetic product reviews using GPT-2 Medium and calculating perplexity.
* [llama-3_review_generation.ipynb](): Notebook for generating synthetic product reviews using LLaMA 3 8B and calculating perplexity. Note that the initialization of LLaMA 3 8B in Kaggle with an NVIDIA P100 GPU (16GB) takes roughly 50 minutes and the generation of 10,000 synthetic reviews takes roughly 20 hours.
* [stat_evaluation.ipynb](): Notebook for the statistical evaluation of the synthetic product reviews, including:
  * Statistical tendencies (Zipf's law)
  * Linguistic features (average length, type-token ratio, verb and noun usage, and readability)
  * MAUVE
  * Inter-rater reliability and PERMANOVA (for human evaluation)
* [market_analysis.ipynb](): Notebook for the market analysis, including:
  * Sentiment analysis
  * Bar chart of the sentiments by review type (Real, GPT-2, LLaMA 3)
