The inside back is a solid silver depression and the front is a dome that is not solid (knotted). You could use it to store a small photo, lock of hair, etc but I use it when I need to carry medication with me. Closes securely. High quality & very pretty.\n","1: Great\n","2: One of the stones fell out within the first 2 weeks of wearing it. Stones smaller than expected.\n","3: Crappy socks. Money wasted. Bought to wear with my tieks. Don’t stay on feet well.\n","4: I LOVE these glasses!  They fit perfectly over my regular, rectangular glasses that I always have to wear in order to see.  I really appreciate having these pretty and stylish and sturdy sunglasses to wear over my glasses.  I'll buy these again and again whenever I need a new pair, which hopefully won't be too soon.\n","5: Works OK for adults and is not at all kid friendly as stated. Slides down my 5 year olds face.\n","6: Great fit\n","7: Would be five stars but they are just too heavy for the size. So cute, gets lots of compliments, but pull the ears down.\n","8: What a cute top! Cam wait to wear in warm weather! Got nice\n","9: Very inexpensive, but too rough and uncomfortable for me, I have to return them..\n","10: Runs way smaller than indicated.\n","11: My son is a big Ninjago fan and these are perfect! The color is vibrant and hasn't faded in the wash. It also is made well and the pocket inserts and filters made it perfect! It looked a bit bigger than expected but once the filter was it, it was perfect to show off the entire design and was a good size for my 6 year old who is closer to the size of an 8/9 year old.\n","12: There are lots of raw edges.  Not well made.  Not at all flattering.  It was more wide than expected and not as long.  I thought this would be cute.\n","13: I really liked this shirt when I received it.  It is a really nice top.  I ordered the brown one.  The color of the shirt really looks nice with the floral sleeves. The surprise is that the sleeves are not T-shirt material.  They are of a good quality chiffon.  The knit fabric is good quality, also.<br /><br />I am 5’4” and weigh about 172 lbs.  I am a 36 DDD.  I ordered an XXL.  It is slightly on the big size.  It looks good, I would just prefer it a bit more form fitting.  The shirt covers my hips (length wise).\n","14: I really like this Tshirt.  Quality fabric.  Soft.  The puffed sleeves add interest.  I ordered the coral.  It is a nice color.<br /><br />I am 5’4” and weigh about 171 lbs.  I ordered an XL and it fits.  It is a bit loose, if you prefer form fitting.\n","15: I received this T the other day.  I took it out of the package and was instantly happy.  The fabric is really soft.  It is also a cute T.  I had to wear it right away.<br /><br />I am 5’4” and weigh about 174 lbs.  I am a 36 DDD.  I ordered an XXL.  Perfect fit.  Pay attention to the size chart.\n","16: Cutest charms for my Easter bracelets.\n","17: Daughter in law loved this. She said it's soft. She's happy.....I'm happy.\n","18: I went through the two original bands that came with the Samsung watch.  I had issues with the little screws and one just broke at the insert tab.  I bought this one as a replacement and after a few months, I'm still loving it.  I haven't had issues and have been able to keep my watch semi-tight on my wrist.  I use the heart rate feature so it can't be super lose.  I'd recommend this band and you can't argue with the price.\n","19: These earrings are more attractive in reality than in the photo.  I am very pleased.  They sparkle and shine.\n","20: Haven't been able to use it yet; it is a cold-weather item.  This is a simple fleece scarf  bought because it is styled with pockets at the ends.  It should function as designed.\n","21: Hat arrived without piece that secured and adjusts strap!  I needed it the next day so I had to sew it together!!\n","22: It is very pretty. But it is easy to break if not really careful.\n","23: Editing my review. I put on the second pair of capri leggings this morning and new in the pack, the crotch had a hole in it where the seem wasn't sewn together right\n","24: It's difficult to say how effective these are, but my grandchildren are wearing them while on their Ipads before bed, and hopefully they will eliminate the blue light that seems to have made it difficult for them to get to sleep.\n","25: Was surprised how wrinkled it is considering how much polyester it contains. I would say that's the only negative part.\n","26: The lenses pop out occasionally, not a fashion statement but does cover all eye area from spit spray. Only bought them for coronavirus protection. Cheaply made\n","27: My son loves this shirt!\n","28: Just fabulous and I love it so much!!!\n","29: Run VERY small , cheap material and not slit up the leg like pix shows... returned\n","30: Absolutely Adorable and perfect for church! Thank you so much\n","31: Had to order 2 sizes up from what I normally wear in Mavi jeans\n","32: I am 5'4&#34;/140 lbs. and ordered the small.  It is so long that it can't even be worn with heels!  I will get it hemmed at an additional cost.  Also, the material is somewhat strange like a tablecloth or curtain, not normal clothing material.  On the plus side, the colors and pattern is quite nice.  I ordered the navy blue with flowers.\n","33: Nice looking top made of a soft fleecy material.\n","34: Nice quality, but was worn n dirty when received.\n","35: GREAT STYLE - MUCH SMALLER THAN CHART\n","36: Love it!\n","37: These are adorable!! My 5 year old said they are comfy and she loves them.\n","38: MY daughter loves this dress. For the price it is pretty but it seems a bit cheap to me and was quiet big on my almost 5 year old and I ordered the 4.\n","39: Dress was to small.\n","40: Nice.pin but small and took forever\n","41: The printed design on this shirt is crooked & off center.  Looks & wears terrible.<br /><br />UPDATE; It's a simple design, but I guess it can easily be printed off center.  The replaced the bad t-shirt with a much better & well centered shirt.  It's nice to see a company do right by their customer, I would recommend them & purchase from them again.\n","42: Purchased the wallet in Amazon for $20!<br />I had the wallet for 2 weeks when I noticed the plastic locking latch & cracked & broken...<br /><br />Called Amazon & they couldn't repair or replace it, so they issued a refund.<br /><br />Then I emailed Sharkk (support@Sharkk.com) to see if they could repair or replace it... being that they are the manufacturer I was under the assumption that maybe they could do something more to stand behind their product!<br />Instead after about a week & a half customer service told me, &#34;...We cannot replace and refund your item. I hope you have a great day.&#34;  So, if I want a new wallet I have to pay $50... Why? Just so the cheap plastic piece can break again!<br /><br />I materials used to make this wallet could be better!  Beware if you buy this cheap plastic/aluminum box, & hopefully you don't have any issues!\n","43: I bought one for my husband for Christmas because my 7 year old daughter loves playing Pokemon Go with him....she was so excited when he openned it that I thought it would be adorable for them to have matching shirts and she was over the moon....the only issue is that this shirt is navy blue and not black like her dads but she didnt really care...it has held up in the wash too...no shrinkage...all in all, two well dressed Pokemon hunters in this house!\n","44: Great little evening bag for summer nights, pool parties, shore vacations.Eye catching and smart looking! Another nice bag from Mary Francis!\n","45: I love this hat! Everytime I wear it people stop me and tell me how beautiful my hat is, I'm thrilled because it's very flattering, it's warm and it's NOT real animal fur. I'd love to have it in other colors!\n","46: This is so comfortable and soft!  I think I’ll order a second jacket.\n","47: I haven't figured out how to get it programmed but it's a stunning watch piece.  Definitely an eye catcher.  Received lots of compliments.  If anyone can send me directions on how to program, that would be much appreciated.  Absolutely love this gorgeous watch!\n","48: Love my glasses.\n","49: I am a petite woman and this product fit over my classes without being overly large on my face. Love the purple print. The print is subtle and adds a nice accent without being garrish.\n","50: Pretty colors and great deal for the price!\n","51: You are going to love this dress! I bought the 5x (I'm a 40DDD) on top and it fits perfectly. I wash it and line dry, no ironing needed!\n","52: My mom loved it! This is her favorite Christmas move so what better present to get her!\n","53: It is absolutely adorable! Can’t wait for my grandchild to wear it!\n","54: Not the a split worst but definitely read the fine print. The photo shows 2 necklaces worn one ties in a knot. But you will only Get 1 necklace. I should have read the measurement better. - tricky tricky sellers\n","55: Loved this. Lightweight. I'm 5'11&#34; and fit my torso really well!\n","56: Love so cute on are little man\n","57: Good quality fit good\n","58: I wish the turtle big for a men i will look fo good size like 4 or5 inches turtle. My son love turtle.\n","59: This is really a cute design idea that was much appreciated by a 16-year-old family member who chose it for a gift.  I can see how it would be cute with a little bit of puff underneath it to display the skirt, but it was also cute just as is.  My reason for giving it only 4 stars was that the fabric was really thin and the placement of the notes on the fabric at the top of the dress was obviously not placed where the notes would have been the most attractive.\n","60: Ood fit and weird material. Wish I could return but window to return passed.\n","61: Really gorgeous but the way the photo is added onto the metal makes me feel as tho it will scratch off soon and the photo came as a weird color like it was tinted differently than the original photo. Lovely quality for the engraving tho and quick shipping\n","62: My daughter loves her “princess slippers “. They fit nice, a little difficult for her to fasten by herself, but they look great.\n","63: I have had ranger boots in the past and loved them. These boots are SO comfortable!! I wear them working landscaping every day and really put them through the test. They are super durable and super comfortable!\n","64: The dress fit well. I’m 5’10” and size 16, the length comes right down to the top of my knees. I got this in the army green and amaranth red color. I’m returning the green though because the color is not quite like the picture, it isn’t as dark. Instead of it being a deep army green shade, mine was more of a lighter mossy color that really isn’t too pleasant, think of green with a touch of poo brown thrown in.<br /><br />The amaranth red shade was much better, though still a bit off from the photo, had like a tint of mauve’y purple to it but I like it.\n","65: I'm 5'10&#34; and a size 16/18. I got this in a size XL and it was just too small through the shoulders, really tight in the arms and too short to be used as a dress. That wasn't surprising though to me, I'm used to dresses running short, if it fit in other ways, I could have used it as a tunic. The fabric was just ok. A bit on the thin side and it almost fit more like a mock neck. The neckline wasn't as scooped as the picture shows on me. If you are short-average height, you could probably make it work as a dress, but on me it just barely covered my backside. Color matched the picture.\n","66: I am 5'7&#34; and about 150 lbs, chest is 38&#34; C . I bought the large and it fits very well, it's low cut between the bosoms, so if you are modest it might be uncomfortable. It's a beautiful floral pattern and the body of the suit is not tight around my middle, comfortable wiggle room. Straps are adjustable.\n","67: Perfect. It was just what I was looking for. Fit nice and is exactly what I thought it was.\n","68: This t shirt is fair, I do like it, but the sleeves could be a little longer. I am giving it 4 stars as it's not great but for the price it's reasonable shirt. It arrived quickly and I have no issues with the seller.\n","69: Material is thin and it's not a high quality top. But it is nice for casual wear and it does fit as I thought it would. Comfy top.\n","70: For the price this is a nice shirt. Very thin material, but it arrived sooner than expected no issue with the service. It is a comfortable top and fits as I thought it would.\n","71: It's really cute it is a little snug and no room for error so if you are not sure order a size larger\n","72: its good and matches my purse; its also genuine leather\n","73: I love the way this is made not flimsy at all it stands up straight then with nothing in it<br />There is a slight shimmery glitter on on the jack picture<br />I carry two large wallets and makeup bag with medicine bottles and girls items and a check book and there is still room and it snaps easily the magnet on the closure is nice and strong I love the accent sides that has Sally's clothes patch work<br />This is a great purse it feels like it will last a while I just got it today I love it\n","74: Bought for a Xmas gift she loves it\n","75: the shirt was actually a size large at most and not a true XXL. nice material though\n","76: More comfortable everyday\n","77: Use a lot for sleep and relaxing\n","78: I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design. I do quite a bit of typing during the day so a thicker/wider band works better for me and this ring has that along with a beautiful design.  I wear it everyday and couldn't be more please with my purchase.  This is an excellent deal for your money!\n","79: Love the yellow and turquoise accents.  Nice bead, but small.\n","80: I'm 5'7&#34; and about 145lbs and a size large fit me very well. I had to get a backless/strapless bra and a pair of spanx to wear it but for the price that's worth it. The material is a bit heavy but not so much that you feel like it is weighing you down. I probably couldn't wear heels with it because then the front would look too short but flats should look good.\n","81: Is beyond cute! I love this necklace!\n","82: Very beautiful jewelry. I love the earrings and necklaces I have bought from this seller. Lots of detail and craftsmanship are apparent.<br />However, Amazon does not carry the matching set of earrings and necklace that the seller provides on their website.<br />The customer service the seller provides is amazing. I definitely recommend.\n","83: The shirt is made well, but the fabric is that weird polyester that a lot of clothing from China is made of.  Cute pattern. This was for my 9yr old son\n","84: Very nice and comfortable.\n","85: Had to return and get another size. Seller was prompt. This dress fits nice. Covers well and it’s airy enough so you feel comfortable. It’s not to thin or see threw. Ha ha really nice.\n","86: Gorgeous ring! It looked dainty and classic, but the ring size was too large. I had to return.\n","87: Wish it were a bit bigger, but Grandson loves it anyway.\n","88: Love the print\n","89: Really good quality, made an amazing gift!\n","90: Very flimsy and lightweight.<br />Scratch easily. I fully expect these to fall apart quickly.\n","91: Great price and fits wider, more muscular calfs. However the ankle is a bit baggy and bunches up.\n","92: Bought as a gift for my teen daughter.  They were longer than I expected, but they are just the way she likes to wear them!\n","93: Larger than appeared\n","94: Very cute belt and this  specific animal print was a perfect match for a pair of heeled sandals. It's versatile and cute with jeans or even With a dress. The construction appears to be decent, with regular wear it doesn't appear as if it would fall apart. I would highly recommend and would definitely buy again.\n","95: Gave as a gift to my son\n","96: It worked for the project I bought it for. It performed much better than screw devices.\n","97: Fits great\n","98: The buckle does not stay buckled. Cute, but constanly picking it up off the floor because it doesnt stay on.\n","99: I am surprised it fits me exactly and for my body shape but it is a little tight on top but well I like it it looks exactly as described and I like it a lot I may just buy a second one in another colour as well.\n","100: These are probably the best pair of pjs I've bought in a long while and they are so comfortable and soft I love them ! I haven't washed them yet so I don't know for sure if they will shrink or not but I don't think they will and even if they did they fit pretty well so I doubt it'd be any issue I just really like the material in general my fav pair of pjs in a long time I really care about comfort when I sleep :)\n","101: I noticed because I have big arms and wide chest that this is extremely small at the top, the dress in general fit very well but it literally was very tight on the arms and at the top in general and I ordered the XL I'm not even that big on that matter so I'd say if you are on the bigger sized chest or similar this dress will not fit. It did not fit me at the arms and that only happens when it's made too small there for me anyway because I don't even have a lot of boobs so that leads me to believe it would definitely not fit someone with a bigger chest either.\n","102: Ultra comfortable pjs!!! Stretch and soft I cannot love these more. True to size.\n","103: I am so excited and happy to have found this dress/jumper short thingy. I really really love it! It fit me like a glove and I have curves and I am a size XL and getting big but this actually fit me fantastically I am thrilled and I can't wait to use it &#60;3 It arrived faster than expected and in great conditions :D I might edit my review with a picture later :)\n","104: Love these shorts! They are so comfortable and fit SO well! I like them quite a lot! They do come in a little smaller than I expected I normally wear an XL and I had to rebuy these at an XXL because the XL DID fit but it was tight and I'm not even that big. I mean I am but not thattt much. So maybe go one size up just in case. I use these for exercising at home and they work great and are very comfy and stretchy so I like them.\n","105: These are great they fit perfectly and they go up the waist also so they're great for holding the tummy and to be in shape I suppose if I used them more often and worked out in them they'd be a great help also to trim the fat :)\n","106: Love it really pretty for the price totally worth it :)\n","107: Just what I needed :) Looks exactly like the picture and I'm a bit on the heavy side so really good fit too :)\n","108: Perfect and so pretty as decoration! &#60;3 I loveeee it so much !\n","109: This is one of the few Asian products that are really true to size that I've bought before. I decided to go for an XL because I am chubby and in the end it was way too big for me should have gone for an L and I have big shoulders and wear bra size 38 as well as big hips too and it still fit well enough. I have a pear shaped body though but it is very true to size and fits perfectly, if you are not sure whether to get an XL or L I hope this gives people a better idea and it really does look like the picture and actually good product 5/5 would buy again.\n","110: This product came in a different colour than the one described in the picture, it was more pink rather than the red one I ordered. Almost a flashy pink colour and the material was really poor quality I honestly didn't expect it to be such bad quality, basically he colour I don't care at all but the quality was just baddd, not very stretchy at all and not even cotton very very thin fabric and just cheap, it looks very cheap in general :( I'm dissapointed because I ordered this product mostly because I thought it was better quality as well as for the color and it's just bad. Save your money, I do not recommend this product.\n","111: I ordered these for an at home beer tasting with friends. I also ordered some beer tasting place mats to go with it. This set comes with 12 cups and the place mats have 4 spots. So this set was not enough for my party of 4 to use. So I ended up using some inexpensive plastic cups that I already had on hand for one person. These cups are nice and sturdy, but they come stacked in sets of three. It was very difficult to pull them apart and one actually cracked while trying to separate it from the stack. Yes, you can wash these and reuse them, but I ended up just throwing them away. For the cost of these, I would rather just buy the cheap plastic cups that I had to supplement with instead of these. If those crack, it's kind of expected.\n","112: I ordered this set of socks for my teen daughter. She was absolutely thrilled by them. She is a huge Fall Out Boy fan and loves these! She loves wearing cute, no-show socks. This assortment has cute FOB logo designs. They are cute, trendy colors, too. The fit is perfect. She wears a size 9 shoe.\n","113: My daughter asked for new seamless underwear. I thought this was a nice assortment of neutral colors. She wears a juniors size medium to large or a misses small to medium. She's 5'7&#34; and weighs about 130 pounds. These fit her well and are very comfortable. They do seem a little longer than other boy short styled underwear that she has worn in the past. Because they are longer, they do hang below some of her shorts so she has to push the legs up at times. Overall, she does like them.\n","114: I can't read anything without wearing my Readers these days. I make sure that I keep a pair everywhere I might need one. I have ordered many different ones and so far, these are definitely some of the better ones. I often wear a pair on the top of my head so I have them handy. These fit well on my head without slipping down. I've had several different ones that keep slipping off my head when I bend over or tilt my head, these do not. The arms are sturdy and give just enough. The frames feel heavy duty and attractive looking. I am very happy with these! These are definitely better than the ones I pick up at the dollar store.\n","115: Plastic and all squished. No thanks.\n","116: No it was terrible.. poorly made I've seen better rings come out of bubblegum machines.\n","117: Loose and comfortable for hanging around the house\n","118: My husband loves how it fits.\n","119: I wear flip flops all the time during the summer outside, and much of the year inside my house (separate pairs to keep the floors cleaner), and am always looking for a good buy.  These are good for the price and, unlike one review I read, spot-on for size (I went with a larger size due to that review and was sorry I did).\n","120: Works great but you need to keep the \"stickers\" to be able to wear them again\n","121: Love them to death#\n","122: Love the colors. Fits great and very comfortable.\n","123: I like these vest  extenders using them I get so air moving through my leather vest. Can get hot in the summer wearing black leather\n","124: Perfect for keeping road dirt off your face.\n","125: soft and warm, thank you.\n","126: Stiff linen material. How can there be stretch stretch? Its linen!Not true to fit. Short in length and tiny waist for Xtra large size ordered. I have a 34inch waist. What else could go wrong?\n","127: Nice looking but too small unless you have tiny fingers and for a bonus turned my fingers black after wearing them. Obviously not pure copper\n","128: Good quality for the price. Comfy and looks great.\n","129: Great dress! Fits well , comfortable, and looks great.\n","130: Overall I like this bouffant. The fabric is thick and it is well made; it fits well. I purchased it when I was working in the COVID unit. I have long hair and throughout the day it would fall apart and feels heavy, pulling and irritating my scalp. I am sure all the girls with long hair know what I am talking about. This bouffant has enough space to fit all of my hair inside without a hair tie. Being able to avoid touching my hair in a 12-16hr shift is a big plus. However, I am rating it 3 stars... because the color faded dramatically after just 1 wash, 1 drying cycle. It's soooo faded now...<br /><br />I recommend this product, just avoid dark color, so the fading is not too obviouse.\n","131: Cheap quality, very small, and it took a month to ship, smells like dead fish.\n","132: Nice. Haven't worn but once. Weather here been in the 80's. Comfy.\n","133: So beautiful. Got lots of complements.\n","134: Socks are easy to put on and fit up to just below my know.  The only issue i have is that for me, it can get a bit sore at the top  of the sock.  likely with folks with a smaller leg than mine, will fit fine and feel fine.  I have to say that these do over all fit me better then any other sock i have bought.  the size i used is M/L\n","135: these were a big hit at Christmas .. and great for the cold.\n","136: Fell apart after a couple washes.\n","137: Cute! But, a smidge short so it’s awkward. It doesn’t quite cover my booty. My booty is big tho. I still wear it with cute leggings, but it would look better over those leggings a smidge longer.\n","138: Fit true to size. Came with a small hole on the seam, that’s why 4 stars. Otherwise cute!\n","139: I like it and get lots of<br />Compliments when I wear it.\n","140: Fits like a glove, I ordered it for Wizard World. I’m still shedding the baby weight so a perfect cosplay was Peter B Parker from Into the spider-verse. I ordered a medium and at first looked like a small but I tried it on a loved it.\n","141: Great belt! Perfect way to dress up an outfit.\n","142: Belt fits well and is a fun accessory to pair with an outfit.\n","143: This is a lovely nightgown, very soft, not heavy but heavy enough to be warm. Highly recommended.\n","144: Soft, comfortable, easy to wash, sized well, highly recommended!\n","145: I loved this tee so much but when it arrived the fit and the cut was really unflattering. Cut more like a man's tee than a woman's so I had to return. Shame as the design on the front was fun and was overall a good quality item. Just hated how it looked on.\n","146: Product was as expected and delivery was quick\n","147: Just as expected\n","148: Larger than I expected. Nice for a little thought. On the flimsy side\n","149: Bought this shirt for my brother and he loves it. Said it was the softest shirt he has.\n","150: To big doesn't sit right at all paw is never even visible\n","151: These are perfect. Very easy to put in and very smooth once they are in. I forget they’re even there\n","152: This pair fit very awkwardly. Someone was in a hurry to finish sewing. It feels as though the front and back pieces were reversed in the sewing process.\n","153: I bought these as a Christmas gift for a fellow Outlander fan. She loved them!\n","154: I haven't worn outside yet, so I don't know about the waterproof factor.<br />I usually wear a medium in men's gloves.  I ordered medium and they're snug. If I order again I'll go up a size. I will edit post to let you all know about them being waterproof.\n","155: Cute, but they turn a bit on the foot. I would buy again.\n","156: I love these tops....I've now ordered 3. They are sheer which makes it more comfortable to wear in layers. For the money spent, it is a great purchase. Will probably get a couple more colors.\n","157: Description is wrong so I'm returning them, no arch support\n","158: I love the fit.\n","159: I gave 5 stars for warmth assuming it stands for coolness. Overall, great mask. My husband loves it and uses it for work every day. The elastic keeps it in place and it’s loose enough that he doesn’t feel suffocated while working in a manufacturing plant.\n","160: My breast were hanging out of the side band because it is cut so narrow.\n","161: This tshirt dress is the most comfortable dress I own. It’s form fitting but super stretchy! The material is super soft.\n","162: I bought this shirt because my girlfriend loves dave grohl, and ive never seen this shirt anywhere else. because it came all the way from Thailand it took a little longer than the impatient person I am wanted it too. BUT its awesome. I love it, and happy with it. I even wrote to the person selling the shirt to say &#34;hey its sucks its gonna take so long&#34; and they were really nice and patient and explained to me that they are in Thailand, which I didn't know.  buy this!!\n","163: Fits perfect love the extra room.\n","164: Horrible, way too big for my daughter and plus when I went to return it, I had to pay an additional $25.00 to ship the return, ridiculous, waiting to hear from the buyer. Just a huge hassle not worth to me.\n","165: Really boxy fitting not at all flattering\n","166: Seems like this work's but I have to try another strength:(\n","167: I really like them,came on time and nice quality for the price would but again.\n","168: Very pretty on,made well and for the price I only wish that they had this in more colors\n","169: Omg! The socks are amazing solo! Comfortable I love the way they feel easy to put on! I'm definitely buying some more!😃\n","170: Can’t wait to make bracelets\n","171: Now!  This is a true Green Bay packers bracelet.  I was expecting something cheap.  It’s not!  This is a very sharp bracelet. Get It and you won’t regret it!\n","172: I really really like these. I ordered more. Too bad they didn’t have more colors\n","173: I like that they were light and the color is pretty\n","174: They weren't quality made\n","175: These are okay. Not very shinny\n","176: Very cheap. Like I got from a bubble gum machine\n","177: This is where all the cracker Jack's prizes are??\n","178: I order this.  looks good but it's not . the material reminded me of the cloth you would wear like a bandage for a broken arm or something  (Medium is small)\n","179: I know this isn't real.  But it really looks bad.  I feel like the pearl is going to  fall off. I always order jewelry.  But this wasn't what I expected. Reminds me of something you would get from a candy machine. Don't bother buying it save your money.\n","180: Sending back for a refund, the stone was to loose,And while I was at the grocery store I lost the stone. Other than that it's very beautiful and true to it's size.\n","181: My daughter loves it! Easy to get on and off. Easy to swim in. Perfect fit. Very modest. Would love to buy a couple more in different colors. I’ll keep checking to see if any come in.\n","182: Comfortable, stretchy, high waisted, and just what I was hoping for. Ended up buying another pair because I like them so much. I’m 5 ft 3 in and 110 lbs and medium was a good fit.\n","183: This is the smallest key chain I cannot even read what it says\n","184: Good Product\n","185: Good Product, super comfortable, light fleece so medium warmth, plenty of stretch, true to size\n","186: Good Product\n","187: Good Product\n","188: Good Product\n","189: Good Product\n","190: Good Product\n","191: Good Product but sizing off\n","192: Good product\n","193: Good product\n","194: The best features of this watch are:<br />1. A 10 yr battery that may outlive me<br />2. Easy to read numbers<br />3. VERY Good illumination of the dial<br />4. Easy to set up<br />5. Allows me to set one screen for DST and the other for EST. I will simply push the button to get to the other time.<br /><br />I am a happy camper!\n","195: Worked very well for my husband and 10 year old son.\n","196: Perfect fit\n","197: Very Comfortable Light Weight Cover All. No Shrinkage After Many Machine Wash & Dryer. Great As Open Light Weight Robe Also.\n","198: This Is An Excellent Support Bra. The Extra Criss Cross give additional support in comforting way & bra is overall prettier than shown in product photos. Lovely.\n","199: Great Shoe Design. Runs Short In Sizing, Sadly Had To Return Them. I Truly Love Them. Next Size Up Won't Work For Me.\n","200: Dress For Is Good. Fabric Is Soft With Good Weight. Drapes Nicely. Color Is Saturated Well.\n","201: I love this dress but the fit was to tight around bust and waist . Order 1 size larger if you are extra blessed in these areas. I Will order again after loosing a few more pounds if it is in stock.\n","202: As a CNA, my feet and legs always ache to the point where I can't walk after a shift. That completely changed after I started wearing these! I am able to actually keep up! I wear these on the airplane, when my legs ache or when I have a POTS flare. I get so many complements on these and would totally recommend!\n","203: My daughter has many medical conditions that makes her medical team nervous when others aren't aware when she is away at college. Having this attached to her Apple Watch (40mm) makes her, the medical team and her parents feel way more at ease. She likes it because it is discreet compared to other alert bracelets she has used in the past. It doesn't bother her at all yet provides the added sense of security we need. Would definitely recommend to a friend!\n","204: Nice bracelet for the price.\n","205: These shoes ran very small. Glad the price was so low. Turns out they made a good Christmas gift. I bought 13's should have bought 14's.\n","206: Just what I was looking for!  Fits perfectly.  Great doing business here.\n","207: Nice quality, looks just like the picture, fits my 5 year old daughter perfectly. No shrinkage in the wash.\n","208: These were exactly as advertised. Ive had these same earrings since 2001 and when I lost the ball off of one then the ring went down the drain i thought I would never find them again but i was wrong!! Love them\n","209: My girlfriend loved it because \"it sleeps comfortably\" and \"it fits\"!\n","210: Keeps time well. I needed a clock for work since we arnt allowed to have phones at work so i keep this on my work badge and helps tell time.\n","211: Piece of crap.  It looks nice in the photo but the minute you pull it out of the wrapping, you see how cheap in is.  That's okay because I just wanted a cheap travel watch.  The big problem is the watch loses time....about 5 minutes a day.  Whoever heard of a battery watch losing time?  Don't waste your time.\n","212: It's good and durable. Looks cute. The bottom button is rather high and the material is thin so definitely an item to wear around your significant other only. It's fairly forgiving. The back is perfect, even for those of us with booty. Looks just like the picture.\n","213: Very happy that I found a good fit.\n","214: There absolutely stunning! Especially for the petite eating wearer!<br />Thank you\n","215: Bought for my niece. Perfect, now we have matching shirts.\n","216: Gift for young man who live next-door graduated high school very attractive and quite reasonable\n","217: Good quality, soft material, love it.\n","218: Love it, quality product and material. As advertised\n","219: Very thin, see-thru fabric, even though a dark print (primary color black)...heavy leotards weren't sufficient... required a \"slip\".....which made the outfit hot (102 outside- Texas Heat Wave!!).<br />Love the print itself....but the quality is lousy, including the manufacturing of the waistband.\n","220: Very comfy, EZ fit but hand-wash only\n","221: Design is adorable but the fabrics for the bag itself were out of the industrial grade bin. The adorable cats are LOST on the rough &amp; cheap grade fabric. The Fade-to-Gray fabric cheapens it further, &amp; don't forget the dull Brown Straps.  What a disappointment! !!\n","222: Very lovely and fashionable enough to be &#34;viewed&#34; under the appropriate fashion garment\n","223: Well made and nice looking\n","224: Under a magnifying glass, these earrings are cute!  Photos in description were misleading .....\n","225: These where too big for me. I wear a 36C, and I’m a older women.<br />My daughter is bigger busted and these fit her.She said they are So comfortable.<br />She buys her bra’s at Victoria Secret, but now she also wears these bra’s more around the house.<br />although for going out sometimes also..<br />She likes these for sleeping..<br /><br />There made ok, but that price it is a good deal.\n","226: I was surprised when I recieved this!<br />Shirt runs big in some places, but not in others.<br />I bought the large, I wanted it to be big for the winter to lay around the house in for cold winter weather in California.<br /> The size is strange. I'm 5'2 136 lbs.. My daughter is 5'6 busty, and would have<br />Bought this in a extra large,  this kinda fit her, but sewed goofy, and material is awful feeling.<br /><br />The material is shiney, not a sweat shirt material at all, and not cozy.  Sleeves are bat wings, wierd. The neck is not exactly round, and too big.<br />The color pumpkin was not a solid color, its like a orange whiteish  stripe!<br />Sewing is not good.<br />Not comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I'm disapointed and waited over 6 weeks to get this.<br />I do not recomend this shirt.<br /><br />.\n","227: Up-date. Beware..This shows in my size and color , Free Returns. So I took a chance and bought it. Big mistake!<br />But when I tried to return this, now the seller wants me to pay for International shipping!!<br />This was a 2 star, now its a One star.<br />I called Amazon, and they took care of my refund.<br />Amazon is the Best, that is why I shop on Amazon.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />The design is ok  but the gray is a strange color. I can't even describe it!<br />For me it ran big, Hugh. I ordered a large, as I can’t figure out if some of the clothes from china ,run bigger, or smaller !.<br />I’m 5’2 138 lbs, older women,  and this was too big, or tight in the wrong places!!!.<br />Around the neck was saggy, and so was the back part of the neck..<br />The back near my waist  was sewed uneven, but in the wrong places.<br /><br />I have found out these tops are a hit or miss. I guess it depends on who is sewing them..Are they 10 years old, or what?<br /><br />The top part has No seams, its made from one piece of material,including the  sleeves , very strange.<br /> The bottom part is a separate piece of material that is sewed  on.<br /><br />I’m returning this.<br />Btw, it took a month to finally receive this!!\n","228: Material is itchy and thin. I did not like this shirt\n","229: Good for anyone who walks unsteady or has slippery floors.\n","230: I even got a size bigger but it still was not long enough. It worked anyway but I was hoping it was going to be like the ad where she's wearing it down/over her hips. Mine ended more at the waist.\n","231: The shirt color is cute (I got navy blue) and I like the texture of material but the fit is very boxy and wide. You have to tuck part of the shirt in to make it look decent. If you leave the entire shirt untucked it looks like you're wearing a triangle...it just sort of hangs out and doesn't fot around the waist.\n","232: Wrong item came\n","233: It's nice and roomy. I have a lot of packed in it!\n","234: nicely made. fits my 4 year old perfectly.\n","235: It looks like moths already attacked it before it got here. 1 wash and it would be over.<br />I like the cotton feel but, this is a seriously cheap sweater. Definitely wouldn't give as a gift.l\n","236: It looks like moths already attacked it before it got here. 1 wash and it would be over.<br />I like the cotton feel but, this is a seriously cheap sweater. Definitely wouldn't give as a gift.l\n","237: This was a beautiful well made and roomy case!! It was far too big fir my 14.1' laptop tho.<br />Lovely and professional!!!\n","238: Good casual dress. Not too short. I'm 5'2&#34; 110lb, I normally wear a small(size 2 dress) and ordered a medium, I should have ordered a small, it would not have been tight AT ALL. I'll take in the waist.<br /><br />It did not shrink in the wash, but I will leave you with this, it's not a dress for Summer time in Florida. No fabric type or wash instruction tags but it almost feels like a cotton mixed with microfiber or something. Very staticky and very warm. I'll have to use it for Fall and Spring. I paired mine with Chuck Taylor Shoreline shoes :) cutesies\n","239: Just love these! My daughter is 3 months old and the bands are almost too big but it's good because they're not too tight.\n","240: I ordered size larger, as I feel too uncomfortable wearing tight clothes. Unfortunately, this was a lot smaller than expected. Would suggest getting two sizes larger.\n","241: Keeps her pants up!\n","242: it is soft and warm and fits perfectly. washes well too. a great buy for the money. great seller!\n","243: it arrived early and packaged well  this is soft, fits wonderfully.\n","244: This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!\n","245: not cotton, more likely a Rayon Spandex mix that will be HOT and therefore it's not something for beachwear in the south.\n","246: I loved the watch but the band is getting frayed and it can't be replaced according to my watch guy.  Its to unusual a size.\n","247: I purchased a few of these as x-mas gifts for my hipsy friends. Its a cute, fun item but upon receipt, it really does not look as well made as in the picture. Still a fun items and worth the price! My friends all loved them!\n","248: This SKINO ALPHABET KEY RING (Letter E KK 83) looks exactly like the product page photo, and that’s a major problem!  Instead of getting the key fob with a base metal “E” on a black enamel ground that I was expecting, I got a key fob with a plastic-covered PHOTOGRAPH of a drawing of a metal “E” on a black ground.  The drawing of the “E” is complete with the phony air-brushed sparkle in the upper left corner.  The ugly “Skino” logo is also prominent.<br /><br />This is the ugliest key ring that I have ever seen.  (My photo makes it look far better than it really is, thanks to the sandstone background.) There is no way that I’m going to carry around a fake-looking thing like this, and it’s going directly into the trash. This is vastly overpriced (about $10 on Amazon).  I would send it back, but the return shipping would cost more than it sells for.\n","249: Soft fabric. Great color. Cute style. Stretchy. Cannot lift your arms as the dress rides up. Way up. If you pull the dress down, it sits at the perfect length, however if you move, the dress rises significantly. I have to return. I am 5ft 6, short-legged and weigh 115lbs.size small.  Fits as pictured, but about 4 inches shorter than the photo when you move. Might be cute with cropped leggings.\n","250: Great length!  I was worried that it would be too short for me, but remarkably surprised that it’s a nice modest length falling to my calves. The white stripes are such that I would require a white slip or leggings for modesty. Neckline is nice. I wish the sleeves were 3/4, but I have a bolero and a star ⭐️ lace jacket I can wear over it for better mosquito 🦟 protection. Have a happy 4th of July, in Freedom.\n","251: I like the idea. But, I wasn’t that pleased with customer service. I measured correctly and ordered accordingly. Placed a call twice and no one answers, just voicemail. I’d probably order again if they had a longer options.\n","252: Sadly, one arrived with a flaw. The lace is pretty, but I won’t be able to wear them to my function on Friday.\n","253: I bought this dress 3 days before prom and it came on time and exactly when it needed to be. Luckily the dress fit perfectly and was elegant and gorgeous and everything I was hoping for on prom. It's modest and has a classic beauty to it. There is lace really only on the front of it and the back is mostly just the solid color with a elegant low back (but not low enough for the bra to show). The cap sleeves are perfect and sit on a place where you don't need to worry about your bra strap showing. The only thing that I would suggest if you purchase this dress is to definitely size and compare your sizes to the charts it provides so that you can get an accurate fitting. Also, it is very form fitting, especially in the bottom area so underwear lines WILL show, so I would recommend purchasing either a thong or very thin underwear. What I did was purchase a stomach shaper that was high wasted and the leg holes went farther down to where it wasn't tight on the dress so the lines didn't show, that way you can also have a little added support and control to any tummy rolls and flatten it all down for a perfect fit. Amazing dress at a great price! Go for it!!\n","254: Comfortable without messy up your hair.<br />Misleading ad!!!  Says 3 pack in header but only only came.\n","255: Cute as can be. I had to cut 4 inches off the length because I wanted a tunic like dress to wear with leggins. I am 5' short. It is well worth the price.\n","256: Nice item at right price. Light jacket for coolish times.\n","257: I love these they are so fun to wear..\n","258: Very pretty but I don't thing it would be very strong for a heavy piece..\n","259: OK it took forever to get here I guess the seller was telling the truth about mailing it. But it really sucks it took so long I been gave up.\n","260: I am so happy with all the mid length little dresses I have purchased this season, this purple one is sassy with the ruffle hem, and cap sleeve. It even has pockets ....\n","261: what a great surprise!  these are the cutest most fun ear-bobs, I just love these\n","262: These do not wear well at all.  Frequent washings have left them nearly threadbare.\n","263: Thought I was getting a ‘normal’ t shirt & mehhhh. The cut is unflattering to me, it’s not as short as a crop top but for a mother of 4 😅 It’s wide & short.\n","264: The dress  fit nice and was comfortable.\n","265: Worst mask ever not breathable. Don't get these.\n","266: Don't get this if you are used to having big pockets in your coats but it is warm and cozy.I ordered a blue one but got red\n","267: This is a fantastic selection of high quality chips.  The bottles are larger than most that I have purchased, so it's a great value.\n","268: These little guys are heavy duty, yet also fine in detail.\n","269: Good value for money, looks like photo, beautiful green color.\n","270: I usually wear a small (5’ 6” - 127 pounds) but the small was really big. The crotch hung low and left a lot of space. The top fit well and the length was ok but the middle was too big.\n","271: I was a little skeptical when I purchased this item. I usually don't buy clothes unless I can try them on first. I'm short and lil chunky.<br />But when I received it, it fit and I liked it so much I ordered in another color! Very soft & comfy!\n","272: I bought these as back-up sun-Gs in a pinch when I misplaced my other pair and knew I had a trip coming up.  They arrived as promised and look as presented in the pic.  Very flattering.  The square frames with the slightest cat-eye tilt bring nice angles to round and heart-shaped faces like mine.  Great pair to have around.\n","273: Very soft material.  Very flowy.  It does fit larger than expected.  I read this in the reviews but even knowing this it was larger than expected.  I am 5'4&#34;, 150 lb, hourglass, muscular, usually buy size 8/10 dresses and jeans and size M/L stretchy bottoms.  I got a medium in this skirt and it sits very loosely around my hips.  I bought it to wear over leggings in the wintertime so I am not really concerned by its looseness, but if I wanted to wear this without bottoms, I would definitely have returned this to get a small. It is a little longer than I wanted as well-- I wanted something mid-thigh or a little longer -- but I get the look that I was aiming for by pulling it up to my waist.\n","274: I was very pleased with the fit of this item however the cross straps on the right sleeve did not say where they belong. The upper cross was way too long any item is being returned\n","275: So soft and comfortable. Always get compliments when wearing!\n","276: Picture is as shown. Material is soft and comfortable. Color is as shown.\n","277: Runs short\n","278: Be very careful to pay attention to details! I thought I was ordering a size 22/24. The 24 was actually a waist size. It was my mistake!!!!! They’re beautiful and I wish I could order in my size. The only reason I gave them 4 stars was to put us larger ladies in notice that the size is in inches.\n","279: Very comfortable fits well<br />Can't go wrong with this brand\n","280: Very comfortable easy to wash and the length is perfect\n","281: Very comfortable easy to wash and being tall fits perfectly the length\n","282: Very good product never been disappointed fits very well\n","283: With the stores just reopening it's hard to find Capri's pajamas.<br />They fit good very comfortable\n","284: Nice looking shirt, but wrinkles very easily.\n","285: Got for my teenage son.. got 2 pack for under $7.. and they’re worth it.. not too mention, they look pretty cool in pe class in high school- Does it get better then that? I don’t think so!! Made/wash well so far.. and used about 2 months.. definitely would buy again! Can’t go wrong for the price I got...\n","286: Bought this dress for my babyshower and it fit as expected. I'm 4'11 so the only thing I did was cut it shorter, but that was just my preference. It was comfortable and stretches too. Color is the same as the picture and I loved it.\n","287: Love the color . Lots of compartments. Zippers are of good quality. Hearty leather is softening w/use ( should withstand loads of use)  makes the over all bag very heavy before adding contents. Straps are a bit to thick for a female shoulder ((have not used it as back pack yet) but the handle on the overall bags works well. Hardware adds style. Received many compliments.\n","288: Very pleased with my purchase.\n","289: Very happy with this shirt. I usually dont buy clothes online because they never fit. This looks exactly as it does in the picture and fits perfectly. I wish I had ordered two.\n","290: I am an older woman,  and I am impressed with this piece, both playful and apt for an evening out against a black dress.  Long enough to double up and still falls nicely around the neck.  I love the Chuvora pieces, so affordable for a unique piece of jewelry.  Beautifully designed and executed.<br /><br />ooh, BTW, the amount of compliments that I have got on this piece and now many piece of Chovura is amazing.\n","291: Perfect\n","292: Nice enough hat.\n","293: Fit right, quality fabric and good boy’s style!\n","294: Very comfortable came very quickly, but I’m going to order another pair in the future. I plan on ordering 1/2  One Size smaller because they stretch out.\n","295: Nowhere in the description does it say this is a model kit with tons of pieces that you have to put together.  Very light plastic and even if I were in the mood to glue a car kit together, it still isn’t worth the money.\n","296: The propellers don’t stand erect.  They fall to the side like a limp noodle.  Very disappointing since I got them for a birthday party.  Had to return them.  The wire is too long and too bendy and the propeller and beads were clearly added as an afterthought.  Don’t waste your money.\n","297: This watch does not keep time, it's really lightweight and flimsy, and broke after 4 days of barely using it.  This was a waste of money.  And the ring.  Don't get me started on the ring.  The metal coating on it was flaking off of it immediately, and it has jagged edges.  Ouch.\n","298: I love the feel of this turtleneck and it fits my daughter perfectly.  I can tell it's going to last a while, which is great.  Even after washing there is no pilling.  Never need to iron it.  I'm happy with this purchase and the price.\n","299: This T-shirt has a great saying which my adult daughter will love!  The quality is excellent!\n","300: My grandson loves pandas! I had to get this for him.  I washed it prior to giving it to him because it smelled like vinegar.  I washed in cold water.  I put it in the dryer on delicate and I pulled it out before it was completely dry.  Since it is angift I was hoping that it would look like new.  It was pretty wrinkled.  Anyhow... he still liked it because it's a panda.\n","301: My grandsons love their new pjs with sharks!!!  Great fit and bright colors!\n","302: Love the style, but so thin you need to wear a slip under it.\n","303: These are the most comfortable pj's  I have found!<br />I especially like that the top is longer....which is flattering.\n","304: Decided I really did not want all of these, but waited too late to return them. Guess I can use them for gifts.\n","305: I like light sweaters in the summer.  This is perfect, nice drape, will work well with some of my sleeveless summer a line dresses.<br />Slimming, with a just a bit of a flair at the hips which I like.  I’m a size 8, ordered medium, fits well.\n","306: Product is exactly as advertised. Great value.\n","307: Good quality & beautiful design\n","308: I use this when running outside in the cold & it works well to keep my ears warm. Haven’t washed it yet so I don’t know how it will hold up.\n","309: This is actually my second shirt because I got bleach on my first one.  I really love the fit and it covers well in length if you’re overweight and don't like your belly exposed.  I wish this came in a multitude of colors and patterns because I would certainly buy more!\n","310: Pretty cool!\n","311: Earrings were exactly what I wanted.\n","312: Love them, Comfy and great price!\n","313: I researched these wraps for a long time trying to make sure I found a soft cotton one that was comfy. Unfortunately, I chose this one. It's so big and the Velcro 8s not long enough so I can't wear. The straps are too short to wear comfortably as well. Also, I do not like the feel of microfiber because it feels weird on my skin. It is not a great product in my opinion.\n","314: When you are pretty in pink you need a pink passport cover.  This one provides rfid and is cute too.\n","315: I actually enjoy these pearls!  The silver chain is delicate and lovely.\n","316: These sweatpants are made of a light material, yet warm enough in colder weather indoors. Have stood up well to laundering and are economical, too.\n","317: I am 5' 8'' with a large chest (42 E). The top &#34;fit&#34;, but it wasn't flattering.The back rode up and then the front sunk down. No support whatsoever.<br /><br />I followed my measurements to a T on their size chart. Like I said, it fit, But wasn't a great match if that makes sense.<br /><br />The bottoms fit and covered the cheeks, but the waistband was very tight. It pushed all my skin around my stomach out. So it was a nice tummy suck in, but everything above the waistband got all squished.<br /><br />So I guess maybe if you had less post baby chest and hips, it'd be a better fit haha<br /><br />Loved loved the colors! So bright.<br /><br />I was really hoping this could be a good fit, but it wasn't. Maybe it could be for you. Just keep in mind that the waistband was VERY tight.\n","318: Bought these as a gift for grandma because we were sick of her wearing her blue blockers that looked too big in her face. These fit her glasses perfectly and now she just has to remember to flip them up and down.\n","319: love the shirt, it looks just like the picture, but the tears are a little scratchy on the skin, I recommend an under shirt when you wear it.\n","320: Synthetic sweaty material. Ill fitting. I can’t say whether this was too large or too small. Technically it fit my waist but the crotch hangs at least 10 inches lower than it should & the top is too baggy but the legs fit as they should. I generally do not have a problem finding clothes that fit online. I was offered a 50% refund if I would keep it but it’s not even worth that. I’m going to pay shipping in order to get the full refund because I can’t even regift this in good conscience.\n","321: Not the best. Too small and broke too easily.\n","322: The only thing he didn't like was no way to adjust the straps\n","323: Bought this for my Granddaughter to replace one her &#34;Papa&#34; had given her that she had lost.  She said she loves it and wears it everyday.\n","324: My dress arrived and it looks nothing like the display picture.  The arms had a thin piece of feathery material on them and hung awkwardly on the shoulders.  The dress was not shaped as shown either.\n","325: It was damaged. The sweater fell apart because it was not sewed together\n","326: It was a gift\n","327: This is a nice fit and color and it looks nice and washes up nice\n","328: Comfortable and light. Love them\n","329: Exactly as advertised\n","330: This is a very nice wool cape. I gave it only 4 stars because compared to others I have purchased the material is very thin.\n","331: Nice soft material and color but shows muffin top.\n","332: Wash well, shrank maybe an inch in dryer but they come long so still cover to wear with leggings. Very stretchy and comfy. Colors are still good after several washes.\n","333: Went up a size to XL to fit waist of 32. Weight 190, 5ft7. Comfortable. Linen color has a slight yellow cast. Washed cool water, dryer for 15 minutes and hung to finish drying. No shrinkage or wrinkles. Not as soft as rayon pants but should soften with washes.\n","334: Super cute and so comfy.  Love them!\n","335: My experiences with previous compression socks were not satisfactory. But, I thought I would give these Copper Fit easy on / easy off socks a try. (I even ordered a larger size than the chart recommended.)<br />Well, I found these \"easy on\" socks are just as much of a challenge to get on, as previous compression socks.<br />My guess is the Copper Fit marketing rhetoric (propaganda) will convince many others to purchase & try these.\n","336: I was a bit disappointed with the length; more appropriate for a boy that an adult.\n","337: Fairly sturdy construction. Really cute. Bendable eye stalks and claws. Folds flat for storage.\n","338: Good compression but very thick, not at all sheer or dressy.\n","339: Love them and get lots of compliments on them.\n","340: Good fit and very flattering\n","341: Its adorable but unfortunately it came broke.  The needle was gone so couldn't use it. 4 stars because it is cute.\n","342: Nice fabric horribly shaped.  Very boxy in the hips and bum and I have both but couldn't tell with these unfortunately.\n","343: Thin jacket but adorable.  Goes with anything.  It fit me just right. I love it!\n","344: Honestly I thought I wouldn't be able to fit these when I took them out of the box. Wrong, these fit nicely. Very soft and a good amount of stretch.  Happy with my purchase.\n","345: Great fit. Material is thin, I wear a tank top under the dress. I bought xs, I'm 5'4\" 115lbs.\n","346: Great fit, very comfortable, I have worn twice and received many compliments.\n","347: Bought them for my son who spends a lot of time in the gym. He loved them enough to order another 3-pack in other colors. Definitely his go-to gym shirt now! They are dry-wick, with small, aerating holes in the material. They fit well and move well. He likes the deeper cut on the armholes, as well. Great purchase!\n","348: So it's a beautiful necklace and would have given it 5 stars but Unfortunately I wore it for about 3 hour's and all of a sudden it fell off and I realized the clasp broke.\n","349: The only time I don't use it is when it's in the launfry\n","350: Very pretty, and larger than anticipated. Heavy, so I would wear this on a wool coat lapel. Or a hat brim. Definitely reminiscent of the Victorian era.\n","351: Title says it all\n","352: This dress looks nothing like the picture—badly made & horrible fabric. When you try to return, company makes you pay the international postage—which costs more than the dress! Do NOT buy!\n","353: Poor quality material and craftsmanship. More like a long-sleeve t-shirt than a sweat shirt. One of the hands was sewn onto the shirt backwards! Still waiting to hear from the company on the return.\n","354: LOVE! This is my go-to blouse for everything: business meeting or meeting friends for lunch. SO comfortable and low maintenance. LOVE.\n","355: As described. Great utility work glove.\n","356: Perfect for a little princess. Great material and great fit. I got the 4/5 for my 5 year old granddaughter. She was soooo excited. It twirls, which if you have a five year old princess, you would understand the importance of a twirly dress!\n","357: These polos are cute, comfortable, easy to pull over your head, and the fit and length is great. They paired nicely with jeans. I will probably buy a few more for summer.\n","358: Perfect for my 5yr old grand. This headband is super soft & flexible. No discomfort. She kept it on for the entire visit. Highly recommend\n","359: I used this to make a 15 inch “Big Girl” necklace for my 3.5 yr old granddaughter. She loves the “secret msg” inside and the “beads”. I love the large, thick bail - so easy to add to a necklace or bracelet.<br />I have already ordered another one for my other 4 yr old granddaughter. 5 stars + 👍🏼👍🏼\n","360: Runs small.\n","361: Screws have continously fallen out and I need replacement screws...Are replacement screws available?\n","362: This shirt looks so cute on me! I loved it instantly. It fits really well and the material is a good quality.\n","363: It is very elegant and pretty. I love absolutely it. The words are clear and I think it makes a wonderful gift. It was packed in a beautiful little box.\n","364: Normally I am a happy Amazon shopper but not this time.  My shirt came with a glaring type O stating I'm Only TALKTNG to my Dog so that tells me there is zero quality control.  It's ridiculous.  It's a hassle for me to return and I will NOT order a replacement.  Truly disappointed.  I will say the shirt is a bit cheap but the fabric is soft & if it said what it was supposed to, I would have enjoyed wearing it.  Not going to happen.  This was a dud purchase.  I could forgive if Amazon would send me a new shirt with no type O's cause this one's on you.  Shame.\n","365: Our fast growing 2.5-year-old granddaughter absolutely adores pink & when she saw her new pink shoes (size 7) she couldn't wait to wear them. Thankfully, they are a perfect fit with just enough growing room that she'll be able to wear them for a while. I was pleased to see how sturdy & well made they are, too. These shoes are a great buy for the money.\n","366: Oh my goodness, our 1-year-old granddaughter/princess was uber adorbs all dressed up for her party! ♥\n","367: Very comfortable stretches good hold your booze very well I like the fact that you can adjust the straps in the front\n","368: I bought this for myself, and it is so pretty, and very well made. Get it, you won't regret it!\n","369: Thin, but so soft and comfy! I would recommend sizing up a size if you like a looser fit!\n","370: I paired this big beauty with a rainbow band.  I really love this ring- highly recommend!  Its very comfortable, and the way its cuts makes it extra vibrant.\n","371: It’s not bad quality, it just runs very small and it’s very short. It could just be me, I’m a 36 DD. It would probably work great for an A or a B cup, or someone that has a belly worth sporting...😀\n","372: The earrings came completely broken, no post at all.  I guess you get what you pay for, junk !\n","373: I generally wear an eight, but this was so small you think it was  intended to be a tight dress or something....  not a swim cover up in the least. Bummer because it’s cute, it might fit my nine-year-old niece, but not a grown woman.\n","374: I do have a big chest 36D, 140#, 5'5 The extra large was way too small, I could get it on, but not wearable. Unless you are a beanpol or teen girl, skip this one. The material is nice,, however unless it was drycleaned, I can't imagaine it would wash well.\n","375: Great quality dress. If you are a D cup or bigger, it might be a little tight, but a smaller chest would be perfect.  The fabric has some weight to it, you can feel it’s a higher end dress.\n","376: Beautiful earrings-top notch quailty!\n","377: Really cute-superb quality.\n","378: You get what you pay for...It looks okay, but the fabric is scratchy.  For the price, I suppose it’s not bad if you just want a new look and you only wear the blouse a few times.... I returned it, regardless of the great price.\n","379: I am not a large woman, except for ‘the DD girls.’ I bought a large, but the smooshed look was terrible. One wrong move and I may have busted out of it. If you’re bigger than a C cup,  this blouse probably won’t be a good fit for you. I was so disappointed... Its a simple, yet very elegant look, and the fabric was great quality for the price.  I wish they had an extra large, because it’s truly so pretty.\n","380: I love this skirt! Looks like a few hundred $ piece!, at such a great price. It is not real leather, but it sure appears to be when you are wearing it. I am going back for the other color. It's also very slimming and trendy for the times.\n","381: Very small, I would order up at least 2 sizes. However, it is darling skirt and looks much more expensive than it was.\n","382: Great quality and the royal blue color I ordered was so pretty and vivid.\n","383: Really thin poor quality fabric. Not a good buy, I'd recommend passing on this one. The picture looks much better than the actual product.\n","384: I'd pass on this one.... The material is cheap and the shape is irregular. The fit does not resemble the picture at all.\n","385: They look like plastic\n","386: Chea[p looking\n","387: Very cute dress\n","388: Gorgeous! Great quality!\n","389: Very poor quality\n","390: It doesn't look like the picture it doesn't come with the strings which want fit my daughter\n","391: THIS LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE ITS MORE OF A VELOUR THAN FUZZY.  VERY DISAPPOINTED\n","392: She loves these socks\n","393: Cheaply made\n","394: These earrings are very ugly & its nothing like the picture.  I wouldn't recommend these ugly things to anyone\n","395: I love this shoe\n","396: My daughter loved this\n","397: Great shoe\n","398: I love the color and how it fit\n","399: Loved them\n","400: The material isn’t what I expected. I thought it would be a cotton blend.\n","401: The sunglasses are okay. No better or no worse than competitors glasses.\n","402: Dress a little big. Beautiful dress\n","403: Runs a good two sizes too big.<br />Not flattering at all.<br />The pink is NOT PINK. It’s an ugly washed out pale orange.<br />Sent it back!\n","404: These bracelets are beautiful and wear beatiful\n","405: The earrings are very well made.<br />I hated they would never stay in place.<br />Did not itch\n","406: The shape. I was expecting a different purple\n","407: This GH own is so soft. The color is as expected.\n","408: These items ARE NOT pink !!! They are purple . The quality is not acceptable . Don’t waste your money .\n","409: This dress is terrific. I got compliments from everyone on the elevator. Seriously.\n","410: People love these.\n","411: These dresses are huge! I ordered a smaller size and it still didn’t fit right! Very unflattering! Returned both\n","412: Such a beautiful pin!! Fast delivery with pretty packaging.\n","413: These pants are everything I love about good yoga pants with the addition of pockets!\n","414: This elevates the look of my outfits for sure. However, at the end of the day, I can't wait to take it off. It might be a bit too tight for me.\n","415: [[VIDEOID:9876547d40377bbe96a8059e72cac134]] I love them so pretty and shiny\n","416: 7.5 were too small, gave to a friend who wears size 6.5.\n","417: Washed one time, air dried and ripped.\n","418: Ugly not worth the money sis.\n","419: Vented fabrics, fits great, material comfortable on your skin, well made and the design fits your head and doesn’t slide off. My intention is to wear a face mask and also wear the neck scarf over the mask. Very good price and the UV protection is great as well. Will buy again.\n","420: Delivered promptly. I am most happy that it is titanium. Looks good on my hand.  Very pleased with my choice. Since receiving this ring I have recently purchase again. Awesome quality, design and very comfortable. Thanks. Yep it works.\n","421: Really cute. Soft material, washable.  I like a loose flowing long dress, bought one size up. Accessorise with light peach jean jacket. Great choice for vacation on a cruise. The colour was my main attraction. SO many possibilities.\n","422: I was very surprised they are very attractive once they’re on ,comfortable and they do not fall down.\n","423: Great just ability, good size\n","424: Wonderful material the print is awesome if it is even better thank you\n","425: Warm, fit great.\n","426: This would of been perfect to hold my mask throughout the day. I have to constantly take it off and put it on. Sometimes I put in on the floor and that doesn't help. I bought this to make things easier on me. Howver the material are low quality the straps feel like they will break. And it doesn't stay on the position I left it.\n","427: This bag is......GORGEOUS !!!  Little larger than I expected, but I love it. There is a smell and I am trying what the website tells to do by putting the coffee grounds in it and it worked.  I have gotteb so many compliments on the details and color.\n","428: Came on time, nicely packaged with batteries.  I've been looking for a ct. scale along with grams to weigh my gemstones.  Perfect.\n","429: Works good to glean and Polish silver, gold & gemstones\n","430: Does not resemble the photo in the slightest\n","431: It was way too small. Maybe when I loose a bit of weight I could fit into it. I forgot I ordered it because it too a while to get to me but that ok.\n","432: I ordered a size XL. It was more like a size XS. Couldn't come close to being able to get it on. I know shapewear is supposed to be snug, but the sizing of this product is way off. Made in China but not for American sizes.\n","433: Very happy with this dress.  Not sexy but very comfortable.\n","434: The nubs on these sandals are harder than I expected, and therefore not as comfy.  I did yard in them, I wouldn't be able to tolerate walking the dog in these sandals.  Regular $3 flip flops yes, but not these.<br /><br />They do keep your foot off the sandal, if you are in need of dry feet in a moist environment.\n","435: I bought this beanie for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves the way it feels and the way it fits him! It fits perfectly over the head and the ears so he is always cozy and warm under the beanie :)\n","436: Pretty bracellet & easy to put on, unlike many bracelets.\n","437: Thank you very much I love\n","438: Notice how the cap is on a mannequin? That's because on no adult female would this cal fit as it is pictured. The reviews are either false or written by women who have heads the size of a 4 year old.\n","439: This shirt is super cute and well made. I was very impressed with the quality. I love how it fits. I'm 5'2&#34; and only 100 lbs so even a size small is often too big on me. This short looked like it would be too big when I first opened it, but after trying it on I really liked the way it fit. It is loose fitting and very comfortable. I love the sleeves and the design on front too, and it happens to be my favorite color! It's super cute to pair with either jeans or leggings.<br />*I received this product for free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion. All thoughts and words are my own!*\n","440: Bought as a gift for my mom. The queen bee loved it\n","441: Love this looks so sparkly\n","442: I really love this purse.  It is small which I like but still carries all the items I need.  The gray color goes with everything.  I'm very happy with my purse.  If you want a small purse without a million pockets, this is the one for you.\n","443: not as expected\n","444: The fabric is slightly sheer so I'll wear a cami, and it has a nice drape. It fits but if you want a loose look, (like on the model), order a size up.  The rosey colors are not bright so it looks delicate. It has a casual look yet, it's very feminine, too.  The gathering at the neck line is elastic so it gives it some shape. I like that I can wash it and not have to iron it.\n","445: Bought as a gift for a friend living in a cold and damp climate. I chose the Klimt based on the reviews and I'm sure it'll look good with her more muted color scheme in her home.\n","446: I love these and own three pairs!!\n","447: Nostalgic! Just as described. Very good chain.\n","448: The shirt is way too small, i recommend going up two sizes if you buy it. It doesn't stretch or anything so it's hard to take off.\n","449: Very nice fits great. Very comfortable!\n","450: Perfect. My daughter loves them. They are easy to get on and very warm.\n","451: Exactly what I expexted\n","452: It is cut on one side, did not fot well and looked horrible\n","453: Absolutely wonderful feel and weight. Cozy. It was just too big for me.\n","454: Stitched together well. Bright. Great price.\n","455: I LOVE these rings! The feel, weight and quality is awesome, no defects and highly recommend!\n","456: Comfy light and pretty\n","457: My grandson who is 16 is still hugely into anime. He is going to love these rings as a Christmas present\n","458: I was a little hesitant at first because it doesn’t have a collar, and it’s partially cotton, but it comes up high enough so that you really don’t need one. It’s a really nice sweater, and it’s warm enough too.\n","459: Nice to wear. Show off cat pride\n","460: Works great for virus protection\n","461: These are the most comfortable socks I have worn.\n","462: the top does not sit still and you will flash people\n","463: really delicate and nicely made\n","464: comfortable no front or back so no uncomfortable feeling if you put it on wrong. Strong and lovely.\n","465: I will keep this, but again not a very good fit\n","466: Great pair of cuff links for my husband.\n","467: So small. Tiny is more appropriate. Feel like it's more of a child chain. Disappointed for a special, not wanting anything more from this maker.\n","468: Great fit. Comes to my knee.  Long enough shorts underneath. Not too thick and not too thin. Cute colors and pattern.\n","469: Really nice set of face masks, styles for both me and my hubby. Plus they are bigger so they are not always pulling on your nose. Just remember to hand wash them!\n","470: Easy to wear, dress up or down.  Extremely comfortable.  Have not washed it yet...we will see.\n","471: They work for me when outside doing gardening or watering.\n","472: very easy to put on\n","473: Love these, soooooo comfortable!\n","474: I was afraid it was going to be small but seems to run true to size.Im a 2x and the 2x runs true to size\n","475: Beautiful but very large.<br />Not heavy.\n","476: Would not fit an 8 year old girl.<br />I orders largest size.<br />Cheap material.<br />Too smal. Sizing a joke.\n","477: The size small frame fit my muggle wife quite nice.\n","478: Love them! The calf area is perfect and the foot area is a little big but I just wear my hospital socks, thick with the non-slip on the bottom, and it fits fine! I've used them every time I go outside and they work perfect! Sand and rain are no match for my red boots!!!!' Really happy I can garden and not destroy my other shoes!\n","479: These were for my son and they fit great. He seems to really like them and they look awesome on him. They got here quickly, seem to be holding up really well and are easy to clean. I will definitely have to look for more pairs in different colors. Thanks!\n","480: The size seemed to big and overpowered other charms. And the tiny ring on it broke within a few hours. Not impressed with this one.\n","481: Weird pockets.5\n","482: Took a while to get here,  but it’s VERY nice!!\n","483: Runs small\n","484: Very please with these bags.  Holds lots of groceries.  Very sturdy.\n","485: The teachers loved them! Best gift this year! According to the kids their teachers put them on immediately lol\n","486: I’ve ordered several of this style dress in different prints and this time I decided to go with the tie-dye and it is a totally different kind of fabric that is a little more slinky and form formfitting/stretchy. This particular one is my favorite! It didn’t shrink a bunch when I dried it. The color is vibrant. The fabric is soft and not cheap feeling like the ones with print designs. I’m going to order more of these in solid and tie-dye colors.\n","487: Not bad if you like cheap polyester. Amazon should stop allowing these products on their site.\n","488: This product is a pure fraud. The quality is substandard,  it comes in child sizes even when ordering a large and XL. (I'm medium btw) it is definitely not like the photo. This is the same super cheap crap you find on wish and I would not recommend this to anyone.\n","489: awesome flower girl gift\n","490: The outfit is good quality but, after a few washes, the material starts getting little balls all over it. Also, I suggest sizing down if you like a more fitted look like the picture of the model.  I ordered a size medium I am 55 and 140 lb. The fit was quite loose, more like a large.\n","491: I am happy with the look and quality of these earrings. They will be just darling paired with just about anything. Gives you that POP of red but, not too much!\n","492: Cool looking and comfortable as well as durable.  Holding up nicely 6 months down the road!  Great purchase.\n","493: Absolutely adorable!  My grand daughter loves them.\n","494: These are super cute and lightweight so they are extremely comfortable.  They are larger than a normal safety pin but still cute!\n","495: So cute and comfortable! Will go with everything\n","496: I’m a size 8/29 in pants and normally a medium or large in dresses.  I ordered this in an XL and it was too tight.  The material wasn’t as expected, it felt like a weird windbreaker material and there is no stretch at all.  I returned it because I wasn’t looking for a bodycon dress, but if it were true to size it would have been cute\n","497: I ordered a medium in these and I’m normally a size 6-8, I’m 5’1” and I was worried about these because of my pear shape and bigger butt.  As far as size goes, they do fit as expected, if you’re closer to a 10 you might want to size up - because they have two zippers on the hips and it might be tight.  Giving this 3 stars because the quality is definitely a cheaper material, although very soft and stretchy, they’re really thin and I don’t see them lasting years and years.  Also, the front pockets are great, but the liner on mine shows very easily.  Also, the waistband on the back wasn’t sewn down so I need to tuck it in and be conscious of that, which is a bit annoying.  The length is great for me, but if you’re tall, listen to the other reviewers - they’ll be too short on you.  I could wear these with heels or flats without hemming them.  Great for the price though!\n","498: The fabric is that weird wannabe chiffon and does not look like the model at all.\n","499: These gloves are just a little too long for my hand. They are very warm, just a little long for my hand\n","500: bought 2 pair,fit good ,black& white.both came with front button broke or missing\n","501: really poor design,bad fit,just put in garbage\n","502: A family member asked me to order this for her since I have Amazon Prime. As always, it arrived on time and was packaged well and  in perfect condition.  About a week after I gave her her bras, I checked in with her to see how she felt about them so I could review them.  She said they are 'FANTASTIC' and they fit well.  She was so happy that no wires dig into her and her breasts do not pop out of the cups like they do in some of her other bras.  She found them to be extremely comfortable as well.  When its time for me to buy some new bras for myself,  I'm definitely going to give these a try.  The price is beyond amazing!\n","503: I have stretched ears, which isn’t a problem, but these hoops hang awkwardly and aren’t wearable.\n","504: Super small, tight and short!\n","505: I love Tyvek and Dinomighty but this pouch is a bit oddly shaped, very small and not very useful.  Super cute though, mine holds mints in my purse.\n","506: Boss is Roll Tide Roll and a golfer!  Perfect gift!  Excellent quality; very lightweight and moisture wicking fabric.  He was very pleased!\n","507: Really?!  It’s the size of a silver dollar.  I have to actually shake it for it to come on.  It lights its immediate surroundings and NOTHING else.\n","508: Havent actually printed picture out yet. Bought for nieces wedding. For her bouquet. That was her grandpa can be with her on her special day\n","509: I needed this shirt as part of a work uniform.  Usually an XL fits perfectly. However, not this particular item. Either it runs very small or it shrunk during shipment!\n","510: You get what you pay for ugh\n","511: I got countless compliments on this stunning Christmas pin. By far the best of the 4 I had ordered  for Christmas.<br />Feels like jewelry.\n","512: This material is simply too light for the attractive style. The shaping is good, but it's a bit big and so not attractive.<br />I'm 5'4\" and 163lb - could have sized down. Not sure I'll ever wear. Cannot return as I live on an island.  Pity.\n","513: I love the fabric of these Max Studio tops! The body is waaay loose though, so I ordered XS when I'm really L. The colour is a bit drab, so I've been having a ball dyeing them in various colours. They look amazing. I have at least 10!👍\n","514: I love these earrings. So classy! I ordered them in the middle of a pandemic, expecting to wear them - where???<br />Not sure.<br />All I know is that I'll be wearing them the next chance I get. Maybe next week they will help to jazz up my mask-look!😂<br />The size is modest. They are light-weight and comfortable - totally stunning!<br />Glad I didn't go with several other less expensive options.<br />I will enjoy these classy earrings.\n","515: These are soft and stretchy, but the legs are just TOO TIGHT for the size - cheapens what could have been a great look!\n","516: Very cute shorts, but definitely not for larger girls. Legs are a bit narrow to be flattering. Nice quality!\n","517: This top really looks more expensive than it is. It's much cooler than expected for my tropical climate and is an easy, casual look. I ordered it in 4 colours - all were great except the red - closer to burgundy which I don't like.<br />Order your regular US size\n","518: Very slimming style, but the seam around the round neckline spoiled a great look.\n","519: This is a 'body-con' outfit.<br />Do not order if you have anything to hide.<br />Seriously, I'm thinking one day I will loose enough weight to wear it under a dressy duster jacket?<br />I live on an island, so returns are hard.<br />In the meantime, it goes into my 'waiting' bin😁\n","520: This is a well-made blouse and the fabriv drapes well. I followed the measurements and ordered my correct size ( scroll way down under the item to see specs)<br /> It  fits as per the measurements, but this tyle of fabric looks better a little loose.<br />Definitely going to order more colours.<br />Without pockets looks more expensive I think. I shall get the lighter colours with pockets to hide my bra a tad and wear more casually. Not easiliy wrinkled.<br />I'm delighted\n","521: Was shocked at the quality here. I hate wearing gowns to formal occasions, so was experimenting with jumpsuit options. Slightly large, so will have  it altered to take out the pockets. Hopefully, it will slim my silhouette some.<br />Fabric is quite thick. Nothing sleezy about this! Great\n","522: Very nice fitting. Only cons are the zipper is made with cheap material and the outfit is a little thin. I have had several times where I had to refeed the zipper back together. Otherwise this is a cute outfit.\n","523: They were big for my face so gave them to my mother she liked them.\n","524: I am using this with the yahaira happy butt no 7 works fantastic. Is a must\n","525: I received &#34;blue&#34; and could have sworn I ordered &#34;black&#34;. Keeping them tho . . .  Too much of a hassle to send back.\n","526: Excellent quality, can't beat this deal for the price!\n","527: Smaller then it appears and the chain is short.  But over all still a nice crystal.\n","528: I love the lotus flower.  However I think the chain is a little shorter then 18 inches I purchased a 20 inch to go with it. Other then that it is gorgeous.\n","529: Just as pictured and comfortable. Great for the wood worker in my life\n","530: You get what you pay for. First of all they’re not big....the ones I got did not look like the two toned ones I ordered. They’re flimsy and cheap. I have them to my 10 yr old. Not what I expected.\n","531: I like this a lot! However it does run a little small. I normally wear a size Large and I ordered a XLarge and I’m glad I did.  It’s very nice and soft and a  perfect length. It is also the perfect weight for me as I am always hot so it nice to have a lightweight sweater to wear.\n","532: Nice fabric,<br />a bit large for a small fellow\n","533: The panties fit, comfortable fabric.\n","534: At this moment I am wearing a pair of these pants I purchased at a big box store in Navy color at least 2 years ago or like $12 bucks.  Same pockets, same style --- exactly.  Not 1 lint ball, not 1 tear.  The only place where there's obvious wear is at the bottom, rear heels area.  (And for that area, I always spray with some Shout before I throw them in the washer).  In the years I have had these pants I have probably washed them 100 times.  THEY ARE AWESOME.  So awesome in fact, that they are my ever go to.  I wear them outside in the yard.  I wear them for quick trips to the shopping.  They still look great and hold their shape!  I thought, \"They're getting old and you wear them so much you better purchase another pair now.\"<br />Now to this new purchase.  First, it is next to impossible to find them online and in the stores.  I know because I have been trying.  Second, I paid twice the amount of money for this new pair (which is NOT ALL THE reason I am giving this product a 1 star.  In fact, if they were of the same quality as my first pair I'd gladly - as demonstrated - paid twice as much with zero complaint and a 5 star rating).  BUT THESE PANTS ARE CHEAPLY MADE!!!!<br />The material is so cheap and poorly made... so awful.  I've washed them twice and they already have those unsightly lint balls!  I don't get it.  They look exactly the same but for the color (because NAVY was sold out everywhere).  My level of disappointment in Eddie Bauer is beyond description.  It is at a level that the brand name means poor quality to me such that I will never buy anything bearing it's name.  When you have such a respected brand name, smart manufacturers guard their quality at a nervous, OCD level.  Not Eddie Bauer.  If you've been looking for a second pair of these pants, just be grateful you have 1 already and go to another brand.\n","535: Lightweight and keep my feet dry. Good support without being overly stiff.\n","536: I gave the Teal 5 stars because it is unique - it was not as pictured, it was a light teal with swirls of brown - but after putting it on the chain, it looks great. I Highly recommend - each slice is unique\n","537: Can't say enough about this bracelet - comfortable, adjustable for smaller wrist. I have purchased more for gifts and everyone - from tween on up have loved them.! Beads are just as pictured. Highly recommend!\n","538: returned it\n","539: These really do help with oncoming traffic headlight glare, i use them when I have to drive at night.\n","540: I like the band, but it came with a face plate to match the band that was entirely to big. So pretty much I got a band only. I sure I ordered the right size. My other bands were fine.\n","541: There a tad thigh so of course I were them under a large shirt. Good quality and very soft.\n","542: couldn't be the price and their very pretty!!!!!!\n","543: Great quality leggings\n","544: Too small..\n","545: Looks nice! The leather could be better quality, it feels a little cheap\n","546: I loved the colors but this band kept popping off of my wrist. I wear exam gloves and a lab jacket most of the work day and I would feel it pop off and be laying in my jacket. Even days when I’m sitting at the computer or playing with my toddler, a sudden motion of my wrist and the band would unclip from itself.\n","547: I got these for my husband who mountain bikes 3-4 days a week. he loves them!\n","548: Didn't work on a ring that I had lost that was Sterling Sterling that was very tarnished. Tried multiple times and returned.\n","549: Beautiful watch, horrible craftsmanship. It broke right out of the box. Contacted customer service, they were &#34;out of the band&#34; and said I would have to wait &#34;several days&#34; for a replacement. Then I didn't hear back from them as to if or when they would be replacing it. I would save my money and buy a kid's watch at Walmart.\n","550: Smaller than what I wanted,but good bag.\n","551: Mine weren't broken went I received them but the nose grips keeps falling off.\n","552: Very comfortable!\n","553: Well, I have more curves than this dress will cover.\n","554: The seam on one of the legs started to come undone after only 1 wear and wash. I bought a few other pairs and had no issues with those ones.\n","555: The collar was wider than I thought it would be, so personally didn't like it but it fit fine.\n","556: Read previous reviews that said to order larger then you normally wear. I usually wear a small but I ordered a Large and it fits how I wanted it to\n","557: the balls are barely held on I was hoping they screwed on but they are just pinched in there if ring flexes you loose the ball would not recommend\n","558: Size up if you want the lose for like the picture. This is form fitting at TTS super cute shirt and it is thin. I like it\n","559: Love these shoes!\n","560: Love them\n","561: After reading reviews,  I ordered 2 sizes up.  There is not a lot of support, when I lay down or lean forward,  they fall out.\n","562: Very pretty earrings! I like the concept of the screw on backs, however they do not screw on far enough. With just the screw on back, the earrings hang from my ear and get caught on my hair,  I put the plastic spacer on,  then the screw on back, they fit a lot better.\n","563: I ordered the size I get for similar products, I was able to get it on,  but it was very uncomfortable. Also it rolled.  Perhaps in a larger size I would not have either problem.\n","564: Love them\n","565: It is the exact color as pictured,  the material is ultra thin ! I thought it was a jogging outfit but I was wrong . Size is a bit bigger than you order , just keep that in mind , it's a baggy fit .\n","566: Great buy at a great price and they were packed great!\n","567: Love these fit great and works as described\n","568: Very cute and soft\n","569: I bought this in a medium for my very picky 16 year old daughter. I didn’t have very high expectations because she didn’t pick it out and usually doesn’t like what I pick out. I must say I was surprised when I first saw this sweater. It looks and feels like a sweater that would be in a boutique. It is a good weight and soft...great quality! To my pleasant surprise, my daughter loves it too. She wore it with high waisted jeans with the front of the sweater tucked in, and it looks really good on. I would definitely buy this again!\n","570: Better quality than expected and very cute!!\n","571: Nice comfy light weight t-shirt, took  almost a month to get, due to being shipped from china, wore twice and probably won't get many more wears out of it due to already pilling.\n","572: I was looking for a gift for my brother who loves wildlife, incl moose. It came packaged perfectly and was a very good quality product. Looks like it costs much more than it actually did. The company is the BEST in regards to customer service. They actually emailed me after shipping to me and told me that shipping didn't cost quite as much as they had estimated, so they were crediting my Visa for the difference and they did! That is the type of company I want to deal with. I will certainly shop with them in the future and would tell everyone else to as well.\n","573: wasn't what i wanted\n","574: Perfect in every way.  Thanks\n","575: Was not comfortable\n","576: No elasticity, poorly made & almost see through!<br />I returned them ASAP\n","577: This is more a designer hoodie. I would need to order 2 sizes bigger to fit into one because it's not a normal hoodie. It's soft but again very slim and not stretchy at all.\n","578: I haven't gotten a chance to wear this watch yet, but it looks amazing. I love the sleek black look it has and look forward to wearing it.\n","579: I LOVE THE COLOR!!! The fit is perfect for me and i look forward to buying as many as I can\n","580: Beautiful color and quality but smaller than I imagined\n","581: These shirts are expensive but they wear like iron.\n","582: These are OK. Comfortable.\n","583: Another favorite Hanes seamless wire free bra, love the colors and the fit. I own several!\n","584: These sunglasses are stylish alone and fit over my Rx glasses perfectly if I should wear them that way or wear them alone. They are very light and fit nicely, no slipping. They fit so comfortably, not too tight or too loose. Recommend these glasses and the price is right!\n","585: I do demo work in grocery stores sometimes near coolers or the front door with cold winter air blowing in. This shirt has lots of body with a somewhat thicker knit fabric. I bought a large size, as sometimes medium can be too tight. It fits perfectly, and didn't shrink when washed. The sleeve length is perfect. I am going to purchase another.\n","586: I’m 5’2” and the small was a bit longer than I wanted. The bottom skirt part flares out (like an “A”) too much for me - I wish it was cut to appear straight down. It makes my hips look too wide. Luckily, I sew, so I can make this adjustment to make it more narrow. I was a little disappointed in how wrinkled it was after a first wash, but my trusty iron will handle that. Overall, a cute and inexpensive outfit.\n","587: I wish these pants were available year-round.  My husband lost weight and we needed to go one size down and were only able to find 2 pair of these pants by ZeroXposur.  He needs six pair for work so I am trying to find more in his size before the fall.\n","588: I got this for Christmas from my husband, but I picked it out.  I did replace the necklace due to it only being a 16inch I think (maybe a 17).  I needed an 18inch.  Beautiful necklace though\n","589: Fit as expected, perfectly. Material strong but comfirtable. Elegant lace, not cheap. Absolutely fabulous! Im 5'6&#34;, 175lbs. Very voluptuous. I can wven use thus dress without a bra, thats how supporting the material is!!!\n","590: Its obviously not silver. Didn't expect it for the price. Nobetheless, its pretty and big. I thought it would be smaller.\n","591: I bought 2!  I have grandchildren that come to our house to swim.  I like to have suits on hand and these fit the bill!  The tank style is much more comfortable and there is no pulling or tugging or adjusting.  They are also comfortable enough that they jump out of the pool and onto their bikes without changing!  These are also made of sturdy fabric so they should hold up to wear and tear easily.  I would definitely recommend!\n","592: Nice ring but colors are a little deeper than in pictures if not in direct sunlight\n","593: Great gift for my Grand Daughter\n","594: Great fit, sleeves are a little long\n","595: My husband couldn't get it going so we worked together to get it set up.  Beautiful  Watch!\n","596: Had to return, didn't fit\n","597: This top runs small. I got one just like it from a different seller but with long sleeves and it fit perfectly, so it's frustrating that two shirts that look almost exactly the same and say the same size are in fact different sizes. It's too small to be comfortable so I'll need to lose a few pounds for this one if I'm going to wear it.\n","598: Love these jeans\n","599: Very light and nice to wear\n","600: Soft and wonderful feel\n","601: I don't care for the bulkiness of the clips.  I was hoping for something a bit more \"dainty\".\n","602: These are adorable shoes and I would wear them with leggings any day of the week.  They seem to run just a tiny bit small so depending on your shoe size, you'll want to be mindful of fit.  I ordered a 9.5 but returned for 10.  All good!\n","603: Excellent fit and looks nice.\n","604: Fits perfect.  Looks very nice.  Drapes beautiful and if you accessorize with a complimentary broach, it's a new sweater altogether!\n","605: I could have found better at Dollar tree. Definitely not what i expected. Looks nothing of power rangers. Very cheaply made.\n","606: Cleans shoes\n","607: I love my sweater. It's exactly as pictured. I bought purple and a size down so it would be more snug, it is very, very warm\n","608: I am very happy that this beautiful blouse fits me. I am a size 12 American. The chiffon ruffle is beautiful. The sleeves are a little short, as I am 5'8\"inches. The fabric is different and synthetic. It works beautifully for my Christmas caroling costume as I have a cape to camouflage the fabric\n","609: I love them but I expected them to be a tad larger.\n","610: Love the army green color. Very soft and comfy. I am 5’4 and this hit about my hips.\n","611: My company color is orange. I saw a fellow coworker with this dress on & leggins. I had to order it. I’m a DD chest so everything fits snug up top. But the dress is comfortable. Hugs the waist & flows out.\n","612: they fit great\n","613: For a quick band to switch out while dressing up my other half loves it\n","614: A little bit small but good\n","615: I bought my daughter and son-in-law steam punk items for a fun night out.  This hat fit perfectly.\n","616: Needed a second pair for around the house.\n","617: When is China going to get pur sizes right?\n","618: I get compliments every single time I wear this. I thought it was just a comfy sweater but it's so much cuter in person.\n","619: It was gorgeous for vacation, but it gave me problems and turned green.<br /><br />It kept getting twisted which would cause my belly button to bleed even though I've had my piercing for 4 years. I haven't had this problem with navel jewelry since I first got it pierced.<br /><br />Also, like I said, the jewelry started to turn green after a couple of months. It really irritated my belly button, and I've never had that problem with other jewelry.<br /><br />Seriously doubt it's actually surgical steel.<br /><br />3 stars because it was really cute in my Instagram and Facebook photos for my FL vacation.\n","620: These r adorable.  I've bought these 4 two baby showers and the babies have worn these on every occassion. Both babies are still wearing and into 9 and 7 months from birth.\n","621: I bought this for my husband.  His original CIB is put away for safe keeping.  He commented that this pin is the correct blue color (apparently some are to blue).\n","622: I bought one of these helmets for myself.  My husband tried to \"borrow\" it, but it was the wrong size.  So, I had to get him one!  He's very happy.\n","623: loved these for my work boots!  fit great...wash up nice.  I usually wear 2 pair of footie socks from another store and now that I got these only need 1 pair for comfort\n","624: Comfortable and nicely made!\n","625: THIS IS THE CUTEST LIL RING ESPECAILLY FOR THE PRICE.<br />LOVE HOW IT DIDN'T COST MUCH AND I WAS JUST ABLE TO ADD<br />IT TO ANOTHER ORDER WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL SHIPPING & HANDLING FEE\n","626: I bought two dresses the same size. One fit perfectly but I could not get this one over my head.  The other one that fit-the stitches were coming out. I returned them both. I am leery of buying now because of the inconsistency.  I am sad as honestly I wanted them all.\n","627: What an unexpected joy. These masks are not only stylish but quite comfortable. They fit nicely under glasses without the fog up. I have gotten so many compliments on them. I tell everyone they need to get them. The adjustable ear straps are a bonus. Might just be my favorite purchase yet.\n","628: These are absolutely precious on my 4 year old!  I got a matching pair in my size and I must say, we rock them.  They feel durable and fit as expected.\n","629: This is an AMAZING suit!! I am so glad I ordered it. I am 5ft 4in and 125 lbs. I ordered a Extra large because it said order two sizes up and it fits perfect!! I feel so confident in it.\n","630: These are perfect googles!  My son loses several pairs every swim season, and it was getting way to expensive to replace them all the time.  These are great, work just as well as the expensive pairs at a third of the price!\n","631: Bought this pajama set to wear during my stay in the hospital when having my daughter. I didn't get them out until at the hospital and there is a hole in the pants! It's now too late to return so I'm stuck with them.\n","632: I took the advice from other reviewers, and ordered a 1/2 size larger than my typical size. They fit perfectly! And they are super cute!\n","633: I did not like the material the color was unflattering<br />I usually buy extra small. I’m 5’ 96 lbs and  medium was way to tight\n","634: I’m 95lbs 5 foot 32B bust. The small fit me just right.<br />I like the light weight fabric perfect for summer I recommend this shirt. Well made. Stitching is good quality<br />I also like the shirt goes down below my hips.\n","635: I’m 5 foot 95lbs. I bought a medium. Works well for me as u can see in the picture”s.<br />I recommend buying this shirt. 🙏<br />For the price and delivered to your front door I highly recommend...<br />I’ve boughten quite a lot of tops from patty boukit over the past 9 years and I truly love this one the most😍\n","636: I’m 5 foot  98 lbs and usually wear extra small but this shit was too tight in chest and arms. A medium would work for me.<br />The color is a bit drab sent back.\n","637: Nice quality for price\n","638: Really cute chunky necklace, perfect way to dress up an outfit. Arrived really quickly too.\n","639: Love this hat, purchased one for my daughter and son. She was able to wear it until she was about 5. Love it because it adjustable head size and truly holds the hat in place in the water and a great sun protector. They wash well and hold there color for hears....worth every penny!\n","640: Started with black..added this blue one.  VERSATILE COMFORTABLE AND WEARS GREAT.\n","641: I really like these slippers.  I wear them inside and outside.  Very comfortable.  Would have like more memory foam to last longer during the day, but it is sufficient.\n","642: Loved this so much that I bought one for myself and one for a friend. I would say that these cuff bracelets would fit \"most\" wrist sizes, but if your wrist is especially large I wouldn't purchase it. It's not meant to completely enclose your wrist, but rather  to be open an inch or so in the back.\n","643: Nice gift!!\n","644: So great!! My guy likely.\n","645: Ankle is highly. A little bit uncomfortable. But nice design!!!!\n","646: Shoulder & backline fit a little big.<br />But dress up. doesn't matter. Look is nice!!\n","647: Very colorful, bright and sparkly crystals.  Own several of these and will most likely purchase more.\n","648: I LOVVVVVE these shorts!!! They fit perfectly...very true to size. Even better, there’s no real stretch built in so they hold things in place. I just bought another pair.\n","649: Bags are large and hold a lot. Very sturdy.\n","650: Bought them for my husband he loves them.\n","651: I bought two of these, in black and yellow. They fit very well, easy to button. The material is very light, which is what I was looking for. Color is beautiful, garments seem well-made. I am very happy with these sweaters, and would highly recommend.\n","652: Smaller than expected. Order a size larger. My son seemed to snag them pretty easy. Not sure if that’s the shirt or my son’s fault. Nice value.\n","653: We bought these for my 6 year old who said he wanted something for his ears so he didn't have to hear the baby crying. lol. He does really like them and it doesn't hurt his head. It is adjustable in size. My only complaint is trying to get them to stay unfolded. They fold automatically and will not stay open unless they are already on the head.\n","654: very cute, although it was a little small.\n","655: Love these they are really comfy!\n","656: Very nice. Changing strap configuration didn't work properly (straps and band buckled when criss-crossed). Lace overlay is delicate it's definitely a hand wash item.\n","657: Its a good size! Very nice!\n","658: Love it! All my cards, are in need order. I don't have the worries that I left a card behind.Every card has a slot. The cards that I don't use all the time. I put them on the other side. The key holder is great for my second set of car keys. Lots of pockets. The long strap is great for food shopping. There is no need to put your handbag in the cart. Which is great security wise. I like the soft lining in the bag. And I use this for work and everyday usage. It has really held up. Just an outstanding bag. Thank you!  FYI It took a long time to get to my home.\n","659: Great value for money. Fots on wrist\n","660: Gaming hat for the roblox gamer in your life. She loved it.\n","661: Bought to wear under my sweaters. Love them. Fit perfect. size is as expected.\n","662: Fit great.  Quality fabric but the hood does not come off.  Trending style for teens at half the mall price.\n","663: Very thin and a very shinny---looks a little cheap.\n","664: Love it\n","665: This hook is larger than expected, but other than that great necklace at a great price.\n","666: I love these earings. They are the perfect size and don't weigh too much. In fact they are routinely stolen by my 60 year old mother and 25 year old sister.\n","667: These were a hit with the kids, but the plastic is brittle and breaks easily.\n","668: These are defiantly not the same quality as the real smith lenses. They are much lighter and have a more plastic feel. The mirroring is not as dark which means people cam see your eyes through the lenses when in direct sunlight. That said the lenses have a nice coloring and are very clear. I would buy these lenses again especially because Smith does not make these glasses anymore.<br /> That said the\n","669: A nice sugar free addition to the Halloween candy bowl!\n","670: Love the look of the shoe.  Can wear them about a 1/2 day before they hurt my feet.  Very stylish!\n","671: This was very pretty. I read the reviews and bought a size bigger. I wish I hadn't. It was too big.<br />I have an hour glass shape and this dress was not flattering on me.\n","672: Great bow tie and color..\n","673: great product and looks good worn too.\n","674: My grandson loved these pajamas! Catboy is the current favorite!\n","675: These are so pretty and do not weigh down my earlobes. Like the way they sparkle too. And they will not tarnish!\n","676: These are too small, the material is thin and cheap, and the storage bag is not attached as other bags used for grocery totes are. I don;'like them.\n","677: Very scratchy and hard lace.\n","678: Super nice quality and in a set of four pairs too! I recommend.\n","679: Cte, but took a very long time to ship.\n","680: Very nice. Very nice, indeed!\n","681: Junk. Garbage. Spray painted plastic trash.\n","682: Kinda stiff. Knee length. Not that soft\n","683: item very heavy and slides to front of my neck all the time, and necklaces still tangle\n","684: Love these luggage tags. It all, I have purchased about five sets of this type from this company. Quality is excellent for fake leather, and the older ones I have have stood up well too many trips through the baggage carousel.\n","685: This cape is  everything I wanted. The weight is not too heavy, not too light; the drape is beautiful; the interior finishing is perfect; and the color is a gorgeous hazel that complements almost any outfit.<br /><br />Some reviewers have expressed disappointment that the cape is not of a heavier fabric. Please keep in mind that full, long capes like this involve a lot of fabric – – if the fabric is much heavier than this, then the garment is overwhelmingly heavy. Also keep in mind that this kind of shape allows you to wrap it around your self sort of double if you are cold.  It also allows you to wear a layer or two underneath in colder weather. For this reason, I adore this item for travel to changeable climates.  And it looks amazing with tall boots!\n","686: Very cute, with a quality look.\n","687: Nice, inexpensive birthday gift for teen girl. Teens love things that are personalized.\n","688: I gave them away because even with the stretch they wouldn't fit.  I ordered a size bigger than I take and they were still too small.\n","689: This was a great bag, but it ended up being too big for what I was looking for. I feel like the measurements in the description were off slightly and I also gauged the height of the bag wrong. Outside of size, this seemed to be a really nice purse and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something in this size range. Item was returned but because of the quality from the brand I intend to look for another purse of the same brand.\n","690: Arrived well packed and on time. Good quality for a fair price. My only complaint is that they're smaller than other readers I've bought - I've attached a photo of the round rimless with a pair of cheapie readers recently purchased from my local Wal-Mart. I'll keep them and wear them anyway - I can live with the small size and will update my review if they don't survive.\n","691: Love my band.  Easy to put on my watch.  I get lots of compliments on my pretty watch band.\n","692: Love this sweatshirt, its very comfy.  I wasn't sure of the sizing so I went bigger to have it loose but its a little too big so I don't think you need to size up for it to be loose fitting.\n","693: Love this top.  Fits well and good quality.  I would recommend.\n","694: Very nice shirt, fits well and is comfortable.  It definitely doesn't look like the pic on me but still nice.  I would recommend.\n","695: Fit is pretty good, ran a little small.  Looks good and is very comfortable.\n","696: These are very nice earrings.  Not as substantial as I had hoped but they look good and I will wear them.\n","697: Great sweater.  Fits well.  It did shrink a little when I washed and dried so it lost a little of its &#34;looseness&#34; at the bottom.  It still fits and I will continue to wear.\n","698: Great bag.  It is a good size, it is big and holds a lot which I like.\n","699: I love this jacket.  It was exactly as described.  It is quite loose as noted, it is not a fitted jacket.  I found that it fits just as it looks in the picture.\n","700: Great robe.  Very comfy and roomy.  It is soft and a perfect weight for a summer robe.\n","701: This is very nice! Very soft and comfortable too. I got complements on it the first time I wore it!\n","702: This is a pretty shirt. Cool for the summer and looks cute on!\n","703: This was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loved it!! So do I!!\n","704: I could have swore I purchased a different brand, but no matter.  The material is great, so soft, nervier wrinkles.  The fit is perfect.  The length is right at the ankle and I am 5’9”.  So it’s perfect.<br />My only drawback on these pants would be the pockets.  They are odd.  They are not placed well or the shape is wrong.  They do buckle a bit which I do not like.  I am not a fan of pockets any way and these are just not flattering.  I am a seamstress as well and I will figure out what is wrong and correct it. Other than that the pant fit well.\n","705: The color is love, a muted pink shade.  The blouse fits fairly well except the sleeves rug short and the waist is large.  The size charts is off.\n","706: Fits way too large around the waist.  It the material is lovely.  The dress flows and drapes well.  I hand washed this dress and hung to dry it came out well.  I am going to try and wash in on the delicate cycle in the washing machine and I hope it doesn’t pill.  Will size down with next purchase.\n","707: Cute cami.  The armhole is a little long, but if you adjust the spaghetti straps too much then you lose the lovely V-neck cut\n","708: Fit my granddaughter perfectly\n","709: Beautiful color.  Size is right on, no wiggle room.\n","710: A great shirt but the sizing is weird.  Does not fit the  U.S. size chart.  My husband is 6’1” 160 lbs.  and I ordered their size Large and it fits perfectly.  Hope it doesn’t shrink when I wash it.<br /><br />I wish these companies that want to sell their product  in the  U.S. would get a clue and use the U.S. standard sizing.  This would cut down on disappointment and costly returns and delays.  Anyone agree give a shout out\n","711: Great sock for low rise boots\n","712: First of all the mentioned elastic at the waist is not there you will find it just under the boobs.  Not what I wanted.  I expected to have a dress that was a little more form fitting instead of a 70 year old  in a maternity dress.  Think about it.  It gave me a laugh.  But with these foreign purchases you never know what their English translation will mean.\n","713: Like B. Unique.  The only problem with This pair of shoes is the strap was very very  short.\n","714: Too much material in the front of pants\n","715: I ordered the purple color but when it arrived it was more of a reddish color.  Not what I needed\n","716: I wanted this dress so badly but the fit is awful.  I believe the size chart needs to be reevaluated.\n","717: Too small in the bust area. Too small from the top of the shoulder to below the bust. Gave it away instead of returning it\n","718: Does not stay in place, even with the anchor tape.  Priced too much for the poor job that it is supposed to do.\n","719: Nice print, fits well but the shirt material could have been better quality.\n","720: Makes my husbands jeans look like they’ve been to the cleaners!\n","721: Awesome quality\n","722: Absolutely Love This Coat very warm and the 1 thing that I really love is it is 2 Jackets in 1\n","723: This is perfect as a liner under another coat when incredibly cold outside, or use in milder weather by itself.\n","724: Use this for a key to my shed, looks great.\n","725: Bought an XL. Just barely fit over my chest and is very short plus tight. Was told I looked like I was wearing a kids shirt.\n","726: It smells so bad and is way bigger then it looks. Also hard to get cards in and out. I would not but this again.\n","727: Does a good job for the price.\n","728: Besides being pretty it covers my face more and more efficiently than standard masks.  Adjustable ears straps easy to slide and they stay in place.  Would buy again. Very nice product.\n","729: This hat is adorable, made very well and I imagine very warm. BUT it is definitely made for a child. My head measures 21&#34; and I could just barely pull it down to my ears. The color is pretty but not as vibrant as my monitor shows.  This will go to my 9yr. old grand daughter.\n","730: Beautiful and of good size and quality. I did have to buy a chain extender but that is no big deal.  Received it quickly, wrapped securely. Will buy more jewelry form this company if they ever become available.\n","731: Gorgeous pillow of exquisite quality.\n","732: Very impressed with the comfortable fit! Fabulous colors and fabulous seller!\n","733: Too tight.\n","734: the scarf is very nice and soft...full size\n","735: These are lovely. Just what I wanted to match a necklace.\n","736: It comes as one solid piece. Less connections to break. Bought for a kid joining the military. He loves them.\n","737: This natural stone bracelet is looking amazing! I like the light blue color and it’s great for daily wear. It’s fashionable and it is comfortable to wear\n","738: I got this bracelet for my mom and she loves it! It’s beautiful and each stone is well picked. And the design is amazing! It goes with all her outfit!\n","739: The tote bad is beautiful! I love the color very much. It’s not Snow White but has the nature of white in it, which is chic. The bag can fit in anything I carry on a daily basis. And the design is amazing!\n","740: Pretty comfortable and stylish shirt. I like the blue color and strap design. The fabric is a little stiff, which is the reason why I give it four stars only. Hopefully it will get softer after I wash it.\n","741: Love this fashionable Japanese style shirt. The design so detail oriented, and it looks so nice on me! Love it!\n","742: Love this crystal watch, as it looks so expensive and good quality. It is beautiful and elegant! My mom is very happy about this order!\n","743: This shirt is very stylish, and it fits me very well. The design is fashionable, and perfect for the work out time. It stretches very well and feels totally airy. Love it!\n","744: Love this 100% cotton shirt. The fabric is such great quality. The true red is very appleaing! Love it and can't wait to wear it when I go out!\n","745: It is a very affordable watch, but it does look expensive. The design is simple yet sophiciated. It will match all my outfits. Love it!\n","746: I recently want to try some classic streetwear. I got these pants and love them. The color is very fashionable, and they could go with any shirts and footwear I have. Cotton blend material is comfortable and airy. Overall, these pants are amazing!\n","747: I live on Oahu, and the rainbow is common to be seen here. I got my mom this rainbow bracelet and the design is so cute and gorgeous! It is light and fashionable.\n","748: The robe clung to me and  was too small. I threw it away cause I  can't return it. I am so disappointed.\n","749: Gave it away\n","750: I would not buy again.\n","751: Weird fit. Decent quality\n","752: Returned this because it was too stretchy so it was too big for me.\n","753: Didn't care for this style. It was snug as are most Wacoal bras.<br />This style gave me a somewhat &#34; pointy&#34; look.\n","754: Does the job. Fits my large calfs quite well.\n","755: The fit was perfect and they feel very nice and soft. Just used for wearing around the house. Some have complained that they are transparent but mine are not at all.\n","756: I like the design  of the pendant !\n","757: I like  the design and intricate detail I wear this with anything in my wardrobe\n","758: This was advertised as an XL hat.  It was so tight that it was uncomfortable, and I don't have a big head.  I returned it.\n","759: Very comfortable and warm for wiinter.  Ran a little big, but the length is nice and long to keep your backside warm.\n","760: Love these earrings real easy clasp you do not have try to catch it in back just hooks snaps worth the money.\n","761: I've bought these several times now for party favors, stocking stuffers, easter happies, and to send to school for class \"treasure box\".  Fun and a great bargain!\n","762: I bought two of them.  They look great, wear well and at the same time bought my son an Invicta for $85 he wanted.  This watch is better looking.\n","763: just what i wanted\n","764: Husband warm for a Halloween costume – he was Granny that the wolf ate\n","765: Seem &#34;cheap&#34;. Way small\n","766: I'm only 5'4'' but this comes above my knees - and I don't like that.  I'm going to add lace or a layer of fabric.\n","767: I truly love these earrings.. color is soft and beautiful and I am very happy with them and highly recommend this dealer.\n","768: Great handkerchiefs.  Good designs and a generous size.\n","769: I had to return these because I couldn't get the collar to lay down,  the collar is cute up, but it drives me nuts.<br />The tops are really well made, I bought blue and red, I wish they had worked for me\n","770: My husband uses these to keep facemasks on because they're more comfortable than traditional extenders. Has used them for sunglasses also\n","771: This is my fav hat. So inexpensive and cooler because of the light coloring\n","772: Very comfy\n","773: Perfect!! Comfortable, lite, fits like a glove...\n","774: It was exactly as promoted and displayed:) Recieved as agreed!!:) Easy to order:):)! Exactly what I needed...\n","775: Very nice for a graduation gift!\n","776: Very soft.  I like it a lot.  Perfect length for me (and i'm 5'5&#34;).  After wearing again, I realize that it does run a little small.  Not enough for me to return it, but definitely order a size up.\n","777: Nice bag, but the only downside are the zippered sections on the front.  I find that they really do not want to open, the zipper sticks and doesn't want to open.  When I persisted and got one side open, I found you really couldn't put anything in there anyway - it's too tight.  As decoration, it adds to the look of the bag, but I was hoping for a usable outside pocket.\n","778: Great for the price.\n","779: Color was as represented. Fit and length was perfect for me. Would buy again.\n","780: As always Patty Boutik doesn’t disappoint but this has got to be my favorite piece of her’s so far.  The material is SO soft but not only does it fit z woman’s body perfectly but the contrast stitching outlines my silhouette magnificently.  I have now bought this in 2 colors for my daughter in law and this is my third color.  Good thing I see lots of different people so they don’t get tired of seeing me in the same (different color) all the time because I always feel fabulous and can count on at least 1 compliment with each wear!  Love Love Love!!\n","781: This mannequin works great. Allows the jewelry to be the focal point and almost faded into the background verses the standard black mannequin. I will purchase again.\n","782: The shirt work rate. Our daughter is in the 40 percentile for her age so she is on the smaller side. Because of this the shirt was a little long. But it still looked wonderful.\n","783: Worth the money, but pretty cheap looking.\n","784: Brought 2 different colors. Yellow and Green durable and easy to tie. Soft. Totally recommend\n","785: Sizes were ridiculously small, I returned all. Very Cheap quality.\n","786: Comfortable slipper. However, the back is not that high and crushes down while wearing. Simply put, the back should either be high like a full slipper or totally eliminated like a slip on to be more comfortable.\n","787: It works, but you have to be faithful and use it regularly.  It does what it suppose to, it even fits good under garments!  Which I really like.\n","788: I ordered what I thought was the appropriate size using the manufacturer's chart. It was so small I couldn't possibly try it on..\n","789: Very nice and well made pin.\n","790: Good pressure\n","791: Not as described at all. This shirt can NOT be worn off-shoulder. The neckline is a standard t-shirt fit and it does NOT have bat-wing sleeves. This is basically just a plain white tee and 100% NOT what they are advertising. Super disappointing.\n","792: I love these glasses! The red is really cool, chic & flattering! They are VERY sturdy & well-made. Like the tortoise she'll too. There's something for everyone's taste. I know I'll wear every pair. They grey is really nice, sort of a transparent grey-blue which is beautiful. Then there's the standard black, which you pull off & look so very good lol.<br />I highly recommend the case. It's really well made, has a cleaning cloth & is very versatile, attractive & sufficient to protect a pair carried in the depths of my purse. It is black with a large band of red down the top. Of course there are different colors available, but I'm very apply with the red & would buy it again & recommend it highly. I love that I could get the coke bottles that I need to read 5.0 & they don't look like coke bottles. All in all a solid hit. Love the. Oh the lenses are very clear, like crystal. Love love love!\n","793: Ok, I read every review for these earrings & i have to comment. First: they are big: yes they are! They are very big! Is that a surprise? Shouldn't be! Just look at he dimensions! They are that big! It shouldn't be a surprise! I love the size! I am a judge Milan fan; check out her earrings & she is a classy lady! Second: cheap appearance. They DO NOT look cheap for the price! In fact, it's quite a feat to create such nice looking earrings for sooo very little money! I am not going to wear these to a big formal affair (although I would not be ashamed to do so( but I will wear them pretty much for everyday, lunch with friends, shopping visits, doctor visits, etc. third: they are too heavy! O my i must vehemently disagree! These earrings are very light & cause NO discomfort at all! I am exceedingly sensitive to heavy earrings. These earrings, surprisingly are comfortable enough to sleep in and are whisper soft. I have. No problem with a review that accurately reflects the cons of a piece. However, none of the complaints listed herein accurately reflect the problems of these earrings. I have tried to completely & fairly represent these earrings. They are very inexpensive , but you get a lot of bang for your buck! I DO wish Amazon would give us some choices! At least 10k maybe 14k since gold prices have dropped so significantly!  Are you listening Amazon buyers? Also, bring your prices back down to a deal cause you now cost significantly more than the products available in local stores!\n","794: Bought as a gift for my Mom and she loves it.  Thumbs up!\n","795: The orange is more of an 'electric salmon' - a smidge of pink undertone, not a 'safety orange' hue.<br /><br />The green is exactly what I wanted; my kid is obsessed with this color. He's a mens 7.5 and these are really almost too short/small. I've stretched a tiny 'run' into one on the first attempt at putting his socks on him. I'd definitely say these are sized more for womens feet, specifically the typically smaller womens sized feet found in the country of manufacture (the average womens shoe size in the US is either an 8.5 or 9 and in Asian countries I believe i read it's more like a U.S. 5 or 5.5.).<br /><br />Can't comment on the compression value unless they calculate compression value with algebra, spandex percentage and the foot size the socks are manufactured for 🤷🏼‍♀️\n","796: This was the first time I used these elastic watch bands.  Super comfortable.  I use it to play tennis.  Fits the watch nicely.  However, it does show dirt.  I haven't washed it yet, but assume it's going to come out.\n","797: I love these! I have many of them in different colors\n","798: Love these crazy round oversized pink sunglasses! So much fun to wear!\n","799: Cute scarf. I wear as a scarf and use as a belt.\n","800: So I loved how these looked, and the fit was perfect, however two of the butterflies gems just fell out after wearing them a day or two. They were not expensive so I'm not really complaining, but if they just held together my rating probably would have been 5 stars\n","801: Great thin undershirt. Fits snug and good to work out in and wear in general.\n","802: I ordered these for my Mom; she had no idea how to use them and neither did I. I'm returning them\n","803: Husband loved it!  Very Nice belt\n","804: I love the idea of the necklace but it's just weird. It doesn't lay flat across my chest and the ribbon started to fall apart the first time wearing it. Awful!!!\n","805: love these glasses!<br />They are actually my 2nd pair, I bought my first pair @tylers. They are awesome quality and durability, they stay on while I’m playing sand volleyball; they are also very light. I also like the nose piece, it does not leave prints on my nose or get stuck in my hair when I rest my glasses on my head.\n","806: Watch band started losing color within 1 week of having. Terrible quality and color isn’t as vibrant as discerned.\n","807: LOVE IT\n","808: So I read that these run small, and therefore ordered a 40, whereas I'd normally go with a 39. Glad I sized up, my toes had just the right amount of room. They are surprisingly comfortable, especially the nicely padded insole which actually offers a bit of arch support. I guess it's the knit sock, but they feel nothing like you'd expect plastic shoes to feel, and that's good! That said, they still LOOK like jellies in that they're kind of shiny. That shininess kind of turns me off, it just reminds me of galoshes or something. I'm keeping them because I desperately need some flats that have arch support, but I don't think I'll order more - just not my thing.\n","809: Great product!!\n","810: This is a nice product, but I am not convinced that I &#34;love it&#34; yet. It makes me look pregnant or that I am trying to hide my belly. Of course, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just get self-conscious with no &#34;form&#34; to the bottom of a shirt. I needed this for a trip I am taking and it seems like it would dry easily, so I will take it with me. But I plan on sewing the neckline in a bit, it's too open for my taste, so I will sew the bottom of the V together about an inch or more, as there are no buttons. The material is not thin, seems like good quality.\n","811: This pendant was lovely, shiny and larger than I thought, but the person I gave it to was happy. It is closer to being the size of a nickel than a dime.\n","812: Sized up but it wasn’t enough. Returning for a bigger size\n","813: Though these are incredibly pretty, I didn’t realize they were not internally threaded (which is what I was looking for). I got caught up in the barbell on each side and the color lol. Good product though\n","814: I’m a curvy girl and these fit great\n","815: I went up two sizes and it's still a little small. I also wish there was a little more fabric on the bottom to give it more of a romper feel than a onesie.\n","816: Great colors, just thinner than I'd like\n","817: Pretty well made. I wear it every day and it is only just starting to show wear on the edges after about two months.\n","818: It came jus as it was suppose tood\n","819: I ordered several items to help my mother-n-law after elbow surgery. Most worked, a few needed to be returned and this was the only one that would not allow me to return it, even in a pandemic and the package isn't opened. Can't tell if it was a good product, but an expensive one if you aren't sure.\n","820: Not much more to say. These were a great find.\n","821: This dress is see thriugh. The fabric is thin and very poor quality.\n","822: It is a nice simple scarf that accents what you wear without over doing it.\n","823: I love this! Mine got really shiny shortly after wearing it. It  draws a lot of attention i get a lot of compliments on it.  This is a great piece to have if you are looking for a piece of jewerly to wear all the time.\n","824: I first worried about it being a fake because I have real moldavite that pulsed in my hand and got hot within five minutes and I didn't feel that. After about twenty minutes I felt pulsing that went into my chest then spread into my shoulders. It is thin I am afraid to drop it because it will break. I am sadisfyed with it over all.\n","825: This is a gift for my mom. She loves larimar.\n","826: I bought this for myself and another for a gift.<br />Very loose but I only wear around house so no problem.\n","827: Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  However, it did not work.  Window to return has closed.  Waste of money!\n","828: Looks great with jeans or leggings and I am tall.  Hits me at thigh level.\n","829: I am tall and this dress did not fit right.  It is too big in the top.  And I am chesty.  In order to get the chest in the right place, I had to pull the halter straps tightly then the waist band was under my bust.\n","830: Bought these for my granddaughter and she wore them once.  The size is a bit small.  No padding in the back of the heel and the shoes rubbed blisters on her heels.  Luckily, she was at summer camp and changed into her flip-flops.  Promptly went into the Goodwill bag.\n","831: Stone is loose and rattled when worn\n","832: looks very cheap\n","833: Just what I expected for my wallet.\n","834: Very nice quality. Nice size. Lovely gift box. Worth every penny.\n","835: This product is a hoot!!  It is so funny-looking that my grand-kids pretend they don't know me when I wear it fishing.  It is fairly cheaply made, but I think it will be okay if I don't treat it too roughly.  And on top of all that, it does the job!  I use it mostly for shade, and haven't tried it in the rain.  I love that I \"take the shade with me\" when I am wearing it.  Sometimes I wear it while working in the yard.  Great idea!\n","836: This is a very heavy weight warm sweatshirt! I've had it for a year now and it has held up great! I hang it to dry... I ordered it huge and it has stayed huge and wonderful. It's my inside the house where I keep the thermostat at 65' survival garment. I can pull the sleeves down over my hands - at the same time the cuffs have enough elastic to stay in place if I push the sleeves up.\n","837: measurements in size chart do not correspond with product measurements.  beautiful pajama set, however.  Deciding whether to return or gift to someone.\n","838: These are great for summer wear. Look nice and comfortable.\n","839: Could be cut a little wider but nice\n","840: Threw it away, fabric cheap.\n","841: I bought these shies for my grand daughter and she loves them!\n","842: The fit was not ad expected\n","843: They are long and fit perfect\n","844: looks great, very small size.\n","845: The fabric was very soft, and the colors were true to the picture. Purchased this as a gift, and it was very well received! Gloves and hat both fit as expected.\n","846: Decent dress,  needed a significant amount of altering upon receipt.  One of the two came with what looked like an extra boob cup sewn below the two cups.  So, since neither my friend or myself have 3 breasts, one of them had to be removed at our cost to make the dress wearable.\n","847: Was not expecting to have to do watch band surgery when i ordered this band.  The material feels lovely against my skin, but the entirely ineffective instruction card that came with the band is telling me to fit the band to my wrist by cutting off chunks at a time and replacing the metal clips.  Unless there is a YouTube tutorial where i can see what needs to be done they seriously need to reconsider selling these online.  They need to be sold in a store where someone trained can size the band for you.\n","848: I have only worn it 5 hours but the comfort is like any other ring. It is exactly as pictured in the description. The fit is perfect, so go with whatever your normal size is.<br />Can not speak to tarnishing or greenfingers yet, but it looks lovely on the hand! I will update this if any issues occur.\n","849: I didnt lay it out perfectly in the pic, but the product is as shown. I usually wear a Small (am 5'4\" 117ish lbs) but got a Medium just in case it shrinks. Without shrinking its a little baggy but not enough that it looks silly. Overall, worth the purchase, as this price rocks compared to other online sellers selling the same cardigan for more!\n","850: The fabric is thinner than id thought. The colors are also brighter than in the picture-- more vibrant/bright than the jewel toned rich colors they had appeared to me in the pics above. Is as long as id thought tho-- im 115 lbs 5'4\" and Small hits right above my ankles.\n","851: Very pretty!\n","852: ****UPDATE****<br />In my initial review(below) I had given these high marks and five stars.  Today, upon trying on my second pair (in black) I downgraded these due to lack of consistency.<br /><br />I initially got the faux snake style.  Different color but same shoe.  However, the black ones are not nearly as great. The sole feels like a regular shoe not anywhere as soft cushy and comfy as the first ones I bought just a week ago.  Disappointed.<br /><br />**********************<br /><br />I am still in awe of how these work.<br /><br />I feel like I just bought magic shoes!<br /><br />I have not been able to walk like a normal human for months now...I reluctantly ordered these sandals.<br /><br />After having spent a small fortune on a sleep boot, plantar fasciitis socks, foot insoles, cold packs, cold socks, warm socks, special running shoes, etc nothing even touched the pain.  Zero relief with all those things I bought before.<br /><br />These shoes.  Magic.\n","853: For school play.\n","854: Horrible shape... makes you look like your nipples are showing... or like you have 2 on each side,  dissappointment... Don’t waste your money!\n","855: I have already noticed that my feet sweat significantly less when I wear these socks. I have no idea why, but the claim is true for me. I accidentally dried them and they did shrink but I have really small feet.\n","856: If you like Buff, do not expect these to be the same. Much thinner. Fit is not as good nor as nice in feel. If you want cheap. This is your deal.\n","857: I really like chokers to dress up casual jean outfits.  I only tried a few of these, but every single one broke as soon as I clipped it on.  They really look nice, but are not durable.\n","858: I had a necklace that was too short and this worked perfectly to extend it.\n","859: Nice feel but a little larger then I expected. Since it is compression I thought it should have a tighter fit.\n","860: Very attractive looking glasses, seem to curb my eye strain from hours of video gaming and/or using my laptop. I even like to wear them when I'm not using screens as fashion glasses. They fit both me and my husband and are of a good quality- I'm not worried about breaking them with every day use.\n","861: I got so many compliments it's ridiculous! Flattering for any body type as the empire waist it's super dramatic but does hide any potentially bloating, neckline is not too low, & length is perfect. Split in the middle is not drastic so it does not fly apart easily but if you are looking for your leg to show even when not walking that will not really happen. Would buy in all the colors!\n","862: This dress is so cute & fit perfectly however the split in the front is dramatic so if you're not paying attention & a good breeze kicks up you may be showing off a little more than planned... Proper undergarments are a must!\n","863: They do not keep feet as warm as hoped.\n","864: They fit as expected and look great.  They are strong for leggings.\n","865: It is made pretty well\n","866: LOVE these earrings!  They are really pretty, not too large, not too small, and really fine craftsmanship!  Am planning to buy a couple more pair as gifts for the holidays.\n","867: Love this!!!!!\n","868: I ordered one of these tops as a gift and upon seeing how well the product fit, I ordered two more tops to use as gifts.  Good choice of color combinations as well.\n","869: Within 2 weeks and 4 days of wear the watch completely stopped. I am majorly bummed because I wanted a decent looking pocket watch but should have realized that this price to look was too good to be true\n","870: I returned the watch did not like it. So I sent back the band it fit good and was a good band but would not the other watch I got.\n","871: Good leather a little stiff at first but it is breaking in fine, good leather is that way.\n","872: Have this to my boyfriend and he loves it.\n","873: Ok first when I opened the box I noticed they were bent. I have some m readers that are,great much better than these. They are,cheap made  flimsy. Small at least compared to other reader.\n","874: My husband is a non-sadal wearer and he wore these comfortably. However, they failed to make an avid sandal wearer out of him.\n","875: Good Quality<br />As described<br />Boyfriend loved as a valentines gift!\n","876: Really nice . I love it .\n","877: Very nice ! Love it .\n","878: My daughter really likes it.\n","879: The color is more of a peach color instead of pink.  It wasn't actually what I wanted.\n","880: Was shipped faster than the original date, outside package well done and protected.  Upon opening the envelope, I found a gift box but when I opened the box I found a small 1.5\"x2\" envelope with the necklace inside all tangled and  knotted up which took me over an hour to get all the knots out. The heart is  pretty but a lot smaller than the picture makes it appear.  Chain so delicate and clasp so tiny it would  be difficult for a normal person to put on themselves or someone else.  Very easy to break the chain due to it being so delicate. Chain in ad states a length of 17 inches but when I measured it , I barely got it to reach the 16\" mark. It looks more like something a child would wear but is far to delicate .  I am not sure whether I will spend the money to return it or just keep it and call  it a loss. It is not something I would ever buy for myself as if it ever caught on something, it would not be worth repairing if it could even be done.\n","881: Great product  Great fit.  Sizing is perfect\n","882: The necklace itself was pretty. It certainly didn’t look real, but it has an interesting shape and sparkle and makes for a nice statement piece.  I think it will look nice up against high necklines of a solid color or a lower neckline just against your skin, check the length to make sure it will hang right.<br /><br />The reason I knocked off a few stars is that The one is received was broken. One of the smaller side chains that connected to the outter most chai was broken and hanging. I considered keeping it and fixing it (I probably could have re-attached it with glue), but it’s ridiculous to spend money on something that is broken. I’m not sure how durable the piece is, so that may become an issue down the road if you purchase this. If you happen to get one that is not broken, it’s quite pretty.\n","883: I ordered this dress in yellow for Easter Sunday. The color was gorgeous. It is a nice bright and sunny yellow - just like the picture shows. The problem with this dress is the fabric. If it had been a bit thicker, it would have been perfect. As is the dress is a thin spandex feeling material - picture thin workout leggings. This makes the dress cling in ALL the wrong places. It literally settled into every bump and crevice on my body. Spanx could not salvage this dress (you could see every spanx line too!) This went back post haste. I suppose if you go up a size or pick a darker color, it might work....\n","884: Item is shrunken sizing. Way too short and way too small. Child size chart is not accurate and should be be banned from marketplace!<br />Very deceiving! Causing a purchase that you have to PAY TO RETURN!!! Useless item!\n","885: Purchased for my 92 yo mother and she loves them.  What is shown is what you get.<br />I am a little concerned about the very thin necklace. I think it could be a bit thicker\n","886: These bracelets are perfect for friends. They’re so nice and they’re easier to adjust.\n","887: It didn't work when I recieved it.\n","888: They are sturdy, but light weight. Color is spot on.\n","889: fit perfect! Wear a M and ordered a M. They actually stay on when I bend over and are not see through. Very warm too. Bought 2 more pairs\n","890: just fine - finally found what I was looking for\n","891: Boots arrived in great condition and fit wonderfully!\n","892: Great value and easy to attach.\n","893: very comfortable\n","894: Love these just wish I could find more in the low cut like these, so tired of boring white socks\n","895: These goggles are great!  they are very well made and the optics were exactly what I was looking for\n","896: Lightweight, great for a quick trip out/to the beach. If you dont like the tag it comes off easily and doesnt leave a mark\n","897: Greta wardrobe addition for travel. I am not the type to like not wearing socks with sneakers etc, and these are a great compromise, covering up to the ball of your foot, they eliminate heat and friction I would otherwise experience without socks. great buy\n","898: Bought as a gift and he really loves them.\n","899: This was an impulse buy but boy! did I make a good impulse decision!! The kimono is absolutely gorgeous! I love the black and gold color. I think I'll wear the black side out, I think the gold side will startle my roommates :-).<br /><br />Very comfortable. I am short a 5'4 guy and the length is perfect for me.<br /><br />I wish it had a few different options to tie the loop, right now, there's only one belt loop.\n","900: Very hard to screw end on.  Screw come loose then lost.\n","901: I received a pair of boots that were purchased on line that were supposed to be dark brown, and were not.  I contacted the company about the mistake, and if I could replace the boots. Apparently the supplier had gone out of business. Rather than accept the refund, I decided to die the boots to the dark brown color of color of Kelly's Leather Die and the Nugget Brown Cafe to get the desired result, I was looking for.  It worked!\n","902: The material inside the shirt is extremely itchy to me even after washing. Had to return it.\n","903: I found the inside material to be so itchy. I had to return it. Also, a small would have fit me better.\n","904: Cute, fits great and very easy to care for, I definitely suggest you buy it.\n","905: Very affordable but I regret the purchase just was a bit flimsy. Would be awesome for a little teen. Overall its cute. Probably wont last or for certain will get lost in a pocket never to be seen again....\n","906: Arrived on time. I'm a RealTree Girl & I love jewelry so this is the best of both. Pendant is a very nice size. The neon green is unique. The cord is sturdy. I think I'm going to buy the blue one, too. Definitely recommend.\n","907: THE BEST HEADBANDS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. I have already ordered them twice. They last SO long and I get compliments on them every single time I wear them. I've worn them to workout, to swim, to spray tan, and everyday wear!! They hold up for so long. I will continue to re order\n","908: The hat is quality, but it looks like a typical baseball cap when it is put on. ! was expecting something a it more classy for the money.\n","909: It looked cute online, but was terribly unflattering. Runs small. Returned.\n","910: It is ok.\n","911: These sandals work quite well for relieving the pain of Diabetic Neuropathy and Arthritis.  They are comfortable to wear, although not made for walking in.  The conductive probes relay good stimulation from the TENS unit with the use of conductive gel or spray, and the pain relief lasted for several days in my case.  There was strong stimulation of the calf muscles in both legs which resulted in a complete cessation of night time leg cramps.  I have heavy scaring and calluses on one foot, but the multiple conductive probes of the sandals were able to work around this problem.  I highly recommend these sandals if you suffer from Neuropathy in your feet, or Arthritic pain in your toes or ankles.  Blessed relief!\n","912: Warm and comfortable!!\n","913: Fits perfectly, a great cross between professional or casual and very comfortable without being too clingy.\n","914: returning. Too big, one size down too small ..this one has a huge elastic twist there's no fixing except  paying for alterations. Amazon needs to stop this 3rdparty cheap app junk.  Disgusted.  Measurements didn't match at all either\n","915: Excellent watch. Handsome and extremely accurate. It looks more expensive than it appears to be.\n","916: Sturdy wallet, but with just a few cars it is quite thick.<br /><br />Wallet should come with money so we know what it looks like inside the wallet and how to keep bills sorted.\n","917: Pretty outfit\n","918: Easily dresses up or down. I wore it with a blue buttonless long sleeve sweater. It was a fun look tying the corners of the sweater up around my waist, but wore sweater down for a casual evening look.\n","919: Easily organizes everything, expedites transactions as everything is visible and easy access. Love it!\n","920: She loved it.\n","921: See through tight and uneven in some areas not a nice product\n","922: Very cute swing dress but no cotton blend, it's polyester.  I love the shade of deep green, it's very flattering.  I prefer to wear with leggings.\n","923: The sleeves are too tight on my arms and I was expecting a cotton blend fabric.  It's polyester and not stretchy or breathable.  It's super cute otherwise  so apple shapes with thin arms will love it.\n","924: These are better than under armour highly recommend former under armour wearer best value also.\n","925: The hat came with the brim wire broken. It was floppier than I expected, so I returned it. The flower detail was cute.\n","926: Cheaply made, but lovely design. The first one I revived had bubbles obscuring the text, but I was promptly sent a new one. Great customer service!\n","927: I sent it back just because its brim was too wide for me; even with the front folded up, there was just too much brim. Otherwise a good quality sun hat.\n","928: Just what I needed for a trip when I didn't want to take my big purse but needed to carry credit cards, driver's license, other ID, + my reading glasses. Great quality and stayed pretty flat even with the glasses in it. I'd buy it again.\n","929: This looks nothing like the picture. I should say the fit is nothing like the picture. Decent quality sweater but HUGE and not cropped or baggy in the cute oversized look sort of way just wide and sloppy looking.. sent back.\n","930: Stiff, stitching nothing like the photo and overall just kinds cheap looking..\n","931: Not as cute in person.. The color was a bit dingy looking and more old fashioned looking than trendy. Material was decent and not see thru. I sent it back but I suppose if it was worn with the right shoes and accessorized it could be cute. I just found it a bit too boxy and overall not as cute or flattering as pictured. I ordered a small and it was a bit big but fit fine I am about 5'5 and 128lbs.\n","932: I am 5'6 and around 126 lbs and (almost) always wear a small in dresses, esp flowy/loose style ones. So I got a small in this and it was too tight across the shoulders and bust (I am 34-36 small C). Nice material and color though :) Sending back for medium. Love the neck! And versatility  to be dressy or casual.\n","933: Super cute, nice quality material and not see thru or sheer like many comparably priced (t-shirt type) dresses. My only complaint is the pockets, most seem to like them I think they are annoying and the only unflattering part of this somewhat form fitting therefore flattering dress. I like how this dress is loose yet has a bit of a shape and not so &#34;box like&#34; or &#34;maternity&#34; looking. I am almost 5'6 and weight around 130 maybe just under and a small is perfect.. it's also a lot longer than the picture almost too long for my personal preference but not quite.\n","934: I was not sure if this would stand up like the ridge.  I can say it has and meet every expectation. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great front pocket compact wallet.\n","935: Great pants..... Keeps the wind off your legs, plenty of pockets, awesome product would buy again. Idk how quick they'd dry because it has some cotton in them but it's a small amount anyways so it should dry fairly quick.\n","936: Love this nose ring.  The bendable aspect makes it perfect.\n","937: I thought it might be too small but took a chance.  It's fun, well made and soft.  Just not large enough for my huge melon!\n","938: Smokin' deal!  Got a few to hand out to homeless this October.\n","939: Very cute for the price\n","940: Bought it for my buddy. Loves it. Very colorful.  Dancing at the grill!\n","941: Look nice for the price but very very small.\n","942: Wrong size does not stretch much either.\n","943: Love them!!!!\n","944: I love these shoes, I bought them in 3 colors. they are very comfortable, and true to size.\n","945: ADORABLE....🥰. Fits perfectly. Pants size 3 & small top size & I got an XS & it fit great.\n","946: Very expensive...Beautiful card though but got a generic envelope...not the one pictured in advertisement.\n","947: Great fit, great value. The case was exactly the right size for a pair of prescription Ray Ban glasses. When it arrived, it had some sort of glue on the case--looked like perhaps the glue used to attach the liner seeped out onto the case a bit. I was able to remove it, gently, with a cloth and warm water.\n","948: Coarse material. Barely got over my head.\n","949: Love it.\n","950: Really cute necklace, just right\n","951: Husband loved them, warm and toasty\n","952: It’s $30 for an amazing dupe. Get it now before it’s gone.\n","953: I bought this as a birthday gift for my grandson and he absolutely loved it. Useful and great value for the money.\n","954: I love these socks. The  color is perfect, comfortable, and I love the quantity.\n","955: These are sized small. Definitely step into these when trying on. EDIT: Customer service contacted me regarding my return of this item. They are very helpful and concerned with any problem you have and willing to send a replacement. Unfortunately they do not offer an xl size. The garment itself seems to be well made for the thin frame. CS contacted me a second time with another style in an xl size. I received it today and I am very pleased.\n","956: I have lots of hair and its waaay too large\n","957: Its an attractive and well made shirt. Has a slenderizing effect\n","958: Shoe laces have no extra length to be trimmed to the proper size and then put the metal cover on. Even if I could trim them the screw and screwdriver they send with the laces don’t really match up well and it’s nearly impossible to see what you’re doing anyway even if the screwdriver wasn’t slightly too big for the screw. It’s a good idea. Not executed well at all.\n","959: does exactly what it should. goes to the knees. will buy again.\n","960: I love these!  They are a perfect fit and the waist is so comfortable, not tight like some.  And I love the soft material.  Very pleased!  Thank you!\n","961: The best sports bra I’ve had and a great deal. Had to size up but that’s fine! Buy these bras- they are amazing!!\n","962: Love this bag and fits everything I need for the gym. Thank you!\n","963: Too tight. I am 5'1, 114lbs 29in waist.<br />Too tight. Too tight, too tight.<br /><br />Very odd fit. Have to wear the waist way up high for the length to be correct.<br /><br />Material is strange, not lined.<br /><br />I try them on and put them back and try them again. I dont think i can wear these\n","964: I bought it large. It is comfortable. The fabric is so soft.\n","965: Good quality metal and looks really cool when wearing them in both my nostril piercings\n","966: Super cute shirt and nice quality, I did buy a 3XL (I'm a size 16) and it fits perfectly. The fit is a little loose, exactly the way I like it. If you like a tighter fit, you might be fine with 2XL.\n","967: They have more universal sizes and the XL should cover up to 40C. The cups don't have the capacity to hold that kind of size, but the bra itself is really nice and if you are a smaller cup size, it will look super cute.\n","968: I'm so disappointed in the bra, it is way too small. I'm usually between a 36 and 38, but went ahead and ordered the larger size, since items from china tent to run a bit snug. The cups are not made to hold a C cup and the straps are not adjustable, since I do have a longer torso, the straps are digging in and the bra is not where it is supposed to be. I had to return it.\n","969: The bra itself was gorgous, the band was wide and comfortable, but even though I ordered a C cup (I'm a B), the cups were way to small and didn't look flattering at all.\n","970: Did not work for me, even though it says A/B and I'm a B, this is more for a very small A size. Bummer, the look was really nice.\n","971: I work this dress to work yesterday and felt like I could wear it into the evening.  It is so comfortable and hangs nicely.  I received so many compliments.  The weight of the material is just right.\n","972: Fun way to wear owls.\n","973: Wash before you wear it. It did stain my pillow case. I had to tighten it a bit. It was a bit large. Good buy for the price. Material is inexpensive. I don’t think it will last the year.  Fit my braids, stayed on through the night. Comfortable.\n","974: Fit well. I’m 5’3” 180lbs I purchased a large. I had to return it because the sequence was catching onto everything. I was afraid of damaging dress so I chose to return it.\n","975: Loved the dress from day one. I’m 5’3” 185 it fit perfectly! I hadn’t been out in soo long and I danced the night away in full comfort. The dress is beautiful! And for the price you can’t beat it!\n","976: Purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend.  She didn't kill me for them, so I guess they worked.\n","977: Purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend.  She didn't kill me for them, so I guess they worked.\n","978: I bought these as a gift for a friend.  They love them, saying that they fit fine and are quite comfortable.  That's about all I can say\n","979: Very nice comforting fit.\n","980: Fits just as I expected it to fit, one more thing I love about Alfred Dunner clothing.\n","981: At 4.99 for the pair and $4.99 for shipping and handling, the hats average out to under five bucks each.<br /><br />I bought several inexpensive beanie hats from different vendors through Amazon and the four that I've received so far from the Florida Hat Company and Hair Coverings are all very good.  They have a nice tight weave, so they are not slouchy beanies; they're beanies that look presentable.  They are all nice, bright colors.  Without any stretching, they each have a circumference of approximately 14 inches, which you can of course stretch to fit a normal size head.<br /><br />I'm a small female who lives in New York and similar type hats have been my hat of choice for years.  Each of the hats that I describe below have a good weave that is adequate enough to keep me warm in temperatures below fifty degrees; I don't find them suffocating hot in moderate temperatures and they keep me comfortable in thirty degree weather.  I'm not foolish enough to stay out too long in temperatures lower than that; my lower earlobes may get a bit cold, but it's not bad.<br /><br />From Hair Coverings, I bought two hats that were labeled royal blue, but in truth one is closer to teal in color and is more inexpensive.  The royal blue is the best of the four hats in terms of the quality of the acrylic yarn and the weave.  It has no pills.  The length is 12 ¾ inches.  The teal hat is also good, but the quality of the yarn isn't as flawless as the royal blue; it's a little pilly, since the thread looks a bit uneven.  It's still a good hat, however.  Its length is 11 ½ inches.<br /><br />From the Florida Hat Co., I received the described hunter's orange hats that come as a pair.  These have a slightly looser weave, but it's so minor that it's barely noticeable.  The yarn is good, no pills.  Its length is 11 ½ inches.<br /><br />If anyone reading this is from the Highridge area of Yonkers and is familiar with the 99 cent store near Pathmark that sold similar beanies, you'll have a better reference as to the quality of these hats.  Each of the hats I bought on-line are within the four to five dollar range; I purposely chose those low prices because I was looking for a hat that's similar to the hats I used to purchase in Yonkers, which had a nice weave, weren't too hot, and have held up well in the wash for years.  Well, the on-line hats meet all those qualities and are a bit larger with a slightly tighter weave.  For me, they're excellent, and I'm glad that I was able to find pretty, bright colors that offer some degree of visibility when I'm crossing the street.\n","982: I'm going to return them. I ordered the size I wear in everything and even on my right foot (the slightly bigger one), I was swimming in them.\n","983: I wanted a pair of earrings that would look nice for day or evening and that I could sleep in as well. These are exactly what I was looking for. I like them a lot. They are very pretty, very sparkly, and still comfy if I lay down in them.\n","984: I wanted to love this. But it was way to small.  But two sizes up.\n","985: I love this shirt. My student's thought it was funny and I was able to use it as part of my lesson that day. Sadly, I did have to explain it to a couple of grown-ups when I wore it to a party. It is SLIGHTLY smaller than true size so buy one size up to be safe.\n","986: It fit as expected, and it held up well in the wash.\n","987: Love the sparkles, color and flower design. Lots of compliments so I shared with many others at work.\n","988: It is very thin and small than I expected. Other than that it is a fine piece.\n","989: Silver jewelry goes attractively with any style or color as a tasteful fashion accessory.\n","990: Very cute on and a wonderful price point. You can dress this down or to go out at night. Very pretty and good quality.\n","991: Fits true to size and I wear it with leather pants and it looks great. Dress up or down.\n","992: Great product-easy-nice packaging\n","993: True to size, very well made.  Cute and warm. Nice packaging- ready for gift giving.  Color is true to website pics. Soft leather and cozy inside!\n","994: Took forever to arrive (but I knew that before purchasing) Worth the wait though. It is lovely. And it is very hard to find a zip up jacket like this with no collar.  The embroidery is nice as well. And the color is pretty.\n","995: PROS:<br />It functions as expected. The venting is great and at least on the black version, blends well.<br />I have a 22&#34; head. It is ALMOST too tight. But works.<br />The top of the hat is deep. So I can pull it down much further than in the photos. Fully over my eyebrows if I wanted.But it is tight enough that if I perch it higher it doesn't slip. (the bow in the back allows for further tightening).<br />CONS:<br />However the material feels more like nylon than polyester and thus makes a TON of noise every time you move your head and the back rubs against your shoulders. And the way it is shaped it cups your ears, funneling that &#34;fwip fwip&#34; noise right in at full volume.<br />If you use the ponytail hole it increases the noisy because it weighs down the back.<br />It also fights with the bow. You want the bow over the ponytail I think, but either way, the bow has to get distorted over or under the ponytail.\n","996: I love these. I have several styles including this one (Same brand, same material) and they all are wonderful. They are soft, they are not scratchy. They fit plus sizes very well. Size 20-26 for sure. But I suspect a8-28 is the full range. Smaller than that and it would be a little loose. It may fit bigger.<br />They stay up well and don't run easily (I have not yet managed to make them run) Note that these are a thicker material. Not super thin like most tights.\n","997: It was an anonymous Christmas gift for a child. I thought it was good because it was a good weight and adjustable.\n","998: Very nice rocks. Smooth and several were nice and large in size. Daughter is happy with them. Paint pens work well to decorate them. Perfect craft for fighting the COVID19.\n","999: Comfy and pretty. I had a dble mastectomy with reconstruction and although the plus size fits me around, it does not cover my breasts fully. Might have to wait to wear until healing is complete. I am only a C so bummed that the bigger size didn't fit. Very pretty tho.\n"]}],"source":["for i in range(1000):\n","    print(f'{i}: {df[\"text\"].to_list()[i]}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/tmp/ipykernel_10944/3603195847.py:6: MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning: The input looks more like a filename than markup.

Bought to wear with my tieks. Don’t stay on feet well.\n","4: I LOVE these glasses! They fit perfectly over my regular, rectangular glasses that I always have to wear in order to see. I really appreciate having these pretty and stylish and sturdy sunglasses to wear over my glasses. I'll buy these again and again whenever I need a new pair, which hopefully won't be too soon.\n","5: Works OK for adults and is not at all kid friendly as stated. Slides down my 5 year olds face.\n","6: Great fit\n","7: Would be five stars but they are just too heavy for the size. So cute, gets lots of compliments, but pull the ears down.\n","8: What a cute top! Cam wait to wear in warm weather! Got nice\n","9: Very inexpensive, but too rough and uncomfortable for me, I have to return them..\n","10: Runs way smaller than indicated.\n","11: My son is a big Ninjago fan and these are perfect! The color is vibrant and hasn't faded in the wash. It also is made well and the pocket inserts and filters made it perfect! It looked a bit bigger than expected but once the filter was it, it was perfect to show off the entire design and was a good size for my 6 year old who is closer to the size of an 8/9 year old.\n","12: There are lots of raw edges. Not well made. Not at all flattering. It was more wide than expected and not as long. I thought this would be cute.\n","13: I really liked this shirt when I received it. It is a really nice top. I ordered the brown one. The color of the shirt really looks nice with the floral sleeves. The surprise is that the sleeves are not T-shirt material. They are of a good quality chiffon. The knit fabric is good quality, also.I am 5’4” and weigh about 172 lbs. I am a 36 DDD. I ordered an XXL. It is slightly on the big size. It looks good, I would just prefer it a bit more form fitting. The shirt covers my hips (length wise).\n","14: I really like this Tshirt. Quality fabric. Soft. The puffed sleeves add interest. I ordered the coral. It is a nice color.I am 5’4” and weigh about 171 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fits. It is a bit loose, if you prefer form fitting.\n","15: I received this T the other day. I took it out of the package and was instantly happy. The fabric is really soft. It is also a cute T. I had to wear it right away.I am 5’4” and weigh about 174 lbs. I am a 36 DDD. I ordered an XXL. Perfect fit. Pay attention to the size chart.\n","16: Cutest charms for my Easter bracelets.\n","17: Daughter in law loved this. She said it's soft. She's happy.....I'm happy.\n","18: I went through the two original bands that came with the Samsung watch. I had issues with the little screws and one just broke at the insert tab. I bought this one as a replacement and after a few months, I'm still loving it. I haven't had issues and have been able to keep my watch semi-tight on my wrist. I use the heart rate feature so it can't be super lose. I'd recommend this band and you can't argue with the price.\n","19: These earrings are more attractive in reality than in the photo. I am very pleased. They sparkle and shine.\n","20: Haven't been able to use it yet; it is a cold-weather item. This is a simple fleece scarf bought because it is styled with pockets at the ends. It should function as designed.\n","21: Hat arrived without piece that secured and adjusts strap! I needed it the next day so I had to sew it together!!\n","22: It is very pretty. But it is easy to break if not really careful.\n","23: Editing my review. I put on the second pair of capri leggings this morning and new in the pack, the crotch had a hole in it where the seem wasn't sewn together right\n","24: It's difficult to say how effective these are, but my grandchildren are wearing them while on their Ipads before bed, and hopefully they will eliminate the blue light that seems to have made it difficult for them to get to sleep.\n","25: Was surprised how wrinkled it is considering how much polyester it contains. I would say that's the only negative part.\n","26: The lenses pop out occasionally, not a fashion statement but does cover all eye area from spit spray. Only bought them for coronavirus protection. Cheaply made\n","27: My son loves this shirt!\n","28: Just fabulous and I love it so much!!!\n","29: Run VERY small , cheap material and not slit up the leg like pix shows... returned\n","30: Absolutely Adorable and perfect for church! Thank you so much\n","31: Had to order 2 sizes up from what I normally wear in Mavi jeans\n","32: I am 5'4\"/140 lbs. and ordered the small. It is so long that it can't even be worn with heels! I will get it hemmed at an additional cost. Also, the material is somewhat strange like a tablecloth or curtain, not normal clothing material. On the plus side, the colors and pattern is quite nice. I ordered the navy blue with flowers.\n","33: Nice looking top made of a soft fleecy material.\n","34: Nice quality, but was worn n dirty when received.\n","35: GREAT STYLE - MUCH SMALLER THAN CHART\n","36: Love it!\n","37: These are adorable!! My 5 year old said they are comfy and she loves them.\n","38: MY daughter loves this dress. For the price it is pretty but it seems a bit cheap to me and was quiet big on my almost 5 year old and I ordered the 4.\n","39: Dress was to small.\n","40: Nice.pin but small and took forever\n","41: The printed design on this shirt is crooked & off center. Looks & wears terrible.UPDATE; It's a simple design, but I guess it can easily be printed off center. The replaced the bad t-shirt with a much better & well centered shirt. It's nice to see a company do right by their customer, I would recommend them & purchase from them again.\n","42: Purchased the wallet in Amazon for $20!I had the wallet for 2 weeks when I noticed the plastic locking latch & cracked & broken...Called Amazon & they couldn't repair or replace it, so they issued a refund.Then I emailed Sharkk (support@Sharkk.com) to see if they could repair or replace it... being that they are the manufacturer I was under the assumption that maybe they could do something more to stand behind their product!Instead after about a week & a half customer service told me, \"...We cannot replace and refund your item. I hope you have a great day.\" So, if I want a new wallet I have to pay $50... Why? Just so the cheap plastic piece can break again!I materials used to make this wallet could be better! Beware if you buy this cheap plastic/aluminum box, & hopefully you don't have any issues!\n","43: I bought one for my husband for Christmas because my 7 year old daughter loves playing Pokemon Go with him....she was so excited when he openned it that I thought it would be adorable for them to have matching shirts and she was over the moon....the only issue is that this shirt is navy blue and not black like her dads but she didnt really care...it has held up in the wash too...no shrinkage...all in all, two well dressed Pokemon hunters in this house!\n","44: Great little evening bag for summer nights, pool parties, shore vacations.Eye catching and smart looking! Another nice bag from Mary Francis!\n","45: I love this hat! Everytime I wear it people stop me and tell me how beautiful my hat is, I'm thrilled because it's very flattering, it's warm and it's NOT real animal fur. I'd love to have it in other colors!\n","46: This is so comfortable and soft! I think I’ll order a second jacket.\n","47: I haven't figured out how to get it programmed but it's a stunning watch piece. Definitely an eye catcher. Received lots of compliments. If anyone can send me directions on how to program, that would be much appreciated. Absolutely love this gorgeous watch!\n","48: Love my glasses.\n","49: I am a petite woman and this product fit over my classes without being overly large on my face. Love the purple print. The print is subtle and adds a nice accent without being garrish.\n","50: Pretty colors and great deal for the price!\n","51: You are going to love this dress! I bought the 5x (I'm a 40DDD) on top and it fits perfectly. I wash it and line dry, no ironing needed!\n","52: My mom loved it! This is her favorite Christmas move so what better present to get her!\n","53: It is absolutely adorable! Can’t wait for my grandchild to wear it!\n","54: Not the a split worst but definitely read the fine print. The photo shows 2 necklaces worn one ties in a knot. But you will only Get 1 necklace. I should have read the measurement better. - tricky tricky sellers\n","55: Loved this. Lightweight. I'm 5'11\" and fit my torso really well!\n","56: Love so cute on are little man\n","57: Good quality fit good\n","58: I wish the turtle big for a men i will look fo good size like 4 or5 inches turtle. My son love turtle.\n","59: This is really a cute design idea that was much appreciated by a 16-year-old family member who chose it for a gift. I can see how it would be cute with a little bit of puff underneath it to display the skirt, but it was also cute just as is. My reason for giving it only 4 stars was that the fabric was really thin and the placement of the notes on the fabric at the top of the dress was obviously not placed where the notes would have been the most attractive.\n","60: Ood fit and weird material. Wish I could return but window to return passed.\n","61: Really gorgeous but the way the photo is added onto the metal makes me feel as tho it will scratch off soon and the photo came as a weird color like it was tinted differently than the original photo. Lovely quality for the engraving tho and quick shipping\n","62: My daughter loves her “princess slippers “. They fit nice, a little difficult for her to fasten by herself, but they look great.\n","63: I have had ranger boots in the past and loved them. These boots are SO comfortable!! I wear them working landscaping every day and really put them through the test. They are super durable and super comfortable!\n","64: The dress fit well. I’m 5’10” and size 16, the length comes right down to the top of my knees. I got this in the army green and amaranth red color. I’m returning the green though because the color is not quite like the picture, it isn’t as dark. Instead of it being a deep army green shade, mine was more of a lighter mossy color that really isn’t too pleasant, think of green with a touch of poo brown thrown in.The amaranth red shade was much better, though still a bit off from the photo, had like a tint of mauve’y purple to it but I like it.\n","65: I'm 5'10\" and a size 16/18. I got this in a size XL and it was just too small through the shoulders, really tight in the arms and too short to be used as a dress. That wasn't surprising though to me, I'm used to dresses running short, if it fit in other ways, I could have used it as a tunic. The fabric was just ok. A bit on the thin side and it almost fit more like a mock neck. The neckline wasn't as scooped as the picture shows on me. If you are short-average height, you could probably make it work as a dress, but on me it just barely covered my backside. Color matched the picture.\n","66: I am 5'7\" and about 150 lbs, chest is 38\" C . I bought the large and it fits very well, it's low cut between the bosoms, so if you are modest it might be uncomfortable. It's a beautiful floral pattern and the body of the suit is not tight around my middle, comfortable wiggle room. Straps are adjustable.\n","67: Perfect. It was just what I was looking for. Fit nice and is exactly what I thought it was.\n","68: This t shirt is fair, I do like it, but the sleeves could be a little longer. I am giving it 4 stars as it's not great but for the price it's reasonable shirt. It arrived quickly and I have no issues with the seller.\n","69: Material is thin and it's not a high quality top. But it is nice for casual wear and it does fit as I thought it would. Comfy top.\n","70: For the price this is a nice shirt. Very thin material, but it arrived sooner than expected no issue with the service. It is a comfortable top and fits as I thought it would.\n","71: It's really cute it is a little snug and no room for error so if you are not sure order a size larger\n","72: its good and matches my purse; its also genuine leather\n","73: I love the way this is made not flimsy at all it stands up straight then with nothing in itThere is a slight shimmery glitter on on the jack pictureI carry two large wallets and makeup bag with medicine bottles and girls items and a check book and there is still room and it snaps easily the magnet on the closure is nice and strong I love the accent sides that has Sally's clothes patch workThis is a great purse it feels like it will last a while I just got it today I love it\n","74: Bought for a Xmas gift she loves it\n","75: the shirt was actually a size large at most and not a true XXL. nice material though\n","76: More comfortable everyday\n","77: Use a lot for sleep and relaxing\n","78: I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design. I do quite a bit of typing during the day so a thicker/wider band works better for me and this ring has that along with a beautiful design. I wear it everyday and couldn't be more please with my purchase. This is an excellent deal for your money!\n","79: Love the yellow and turquoise accents. Nice bead, but small.\n","80: I'm 5'7\" and about 145lbs and a size large fit me very well. I had to get a backless/strapless bra and a pair of spanx to wear it but for the price that's worth it. The material is a bit heavy but not so much that you feel like it is weighing you down. I probably couldn't wear heels with it because then the front would look too short but flats should look good.\n","81: Is beyond cute! I love this necklace!\n","82: Very beautiful jewelry. I love the earrings and necklaces I have bought from this seller. Lots of detail and craftsmanship are apparent.However, Amazon does not carry the matching set of earrings and necklace that the seller provides on their website.The customer service the seller provides is amazing. I definitely recommend.\n","83: The shirt is made well, but the fabric is that weird polyester that a lot of clothing from China is made of. Cute pattern. This was for my 9yr old son\n","84: Very nice and comfortable.\n","85: Had to return and get another size. Seller was prompt. This dress fits nice. Covers well and it’s airy enough so you feel comfortable. It’s not to thin or see threw. Ha ha really nice.\n","86: Gorgeous ring! It looked dainty and classic, but the ring size was too large. I had to return.\n","87: Wish it were a bit bigger, but Grandson loves it anyway.\n","88: Love the print\n","89: Really good quality, made an amazing gift!\n","90: Very flimsy and lightweight.Scratch easily. I fully expect these to fall apart quickly.\n","91: Great price and fits wider, more muscular calfs. However the ankle is a bit baggy and bunches up.\n","92: Bought as a gift for my teen daughter. They were longer than I expected, but they are just the way she likes to wear them!\n","93: Larger than appeared\n","94: Very cute belt and this specific animal print was a perfect match for a pair of heeled sandals. It's versatile and cute with jeans or even With a dress. The construction appears to be decent, with regular wear it doesn't appear as if it would fall apart. I would highly recommend and would definitely buy again.\n","95: Gave as a gift to my son\n","96: It worked for the project I bought it for. It performed much better than screw devices.\n","97: Fits great\n","98: The buckle does not stay buckled. Cute, but constanly picking it up off the floor because it doesnt stay on.\n","99: I am surprised it fits me exactly and for my body shape but it is a little tight on top but well I like it it looks exactly as described and I like it a lot I may just buy a second one in another colour as well.\n","100: These are probably the best pair of pjs I've bought in a long while and they are so comfortable and soft I love them ! I haven't washed them yet so I don't know for sure if they will shrink or not but I don't think they will and even if they did they fit pretty well so I doubt it'd be any issue I just really like the material in general my fav pair of pjs in a long time I really care about comfort when I sleep :)\n","101: I noticed because I have big arms and wide chest that this is extremely small at the top, the dress in general fit very well but it literally was very tight on the arms and at the top in general and I ordered the XL I'm not even that big on that matter so I'd say if you are on the bigger sized chest or similar this dress will not fit. It did not fit me at the arms and that only happens when it's made too small there for me anyway because I don't even have a lot of boobs so that leads me to believe it would definitely not fit someone with a bigger chest either.\n","102: Ultra comfortable pjs!!! Stretch and soft I cannot love these more. True to size.\n","103: I am so excited and happy to have found this dress/jumper short thingy. I really really love it! It fit me like a glove and I have curves and I am a size XL and getting big but this actually fit me fantastically I am thrilled and I can't wait to use it <3 It arrived faster than expected and in great conditions :D I might edit my review with a picture later :)\n","104: Love these shorts! They are so comfortable and fit SO well! I like them quite a lot! They do come in a little smaller than I expected I normally wear an XL and I had to rebuy these at an XXL because the XL DID fit but it was tight and I'm not even that big. I mean I am but not thattt much. So maybe go one size up just in case. I use these for exercising at home and they work great and are very comfy and stretchy so I like them.\n","105: These are great they fit perfectly and they go up the waist also so they're great for holding the tummy and to be in shape I suppose if I used them more often and worked out in them they'd be a great help also to trim the fat :)\n","106: Love it really pretty for the price totally worth it :)\n","107: Just what I needed :) Looks exactly like the picture and I'm a bit on the heavy side so really good fit too :)\n","108: Perfect and so pretty as decoration! <3 I loveeee it so much !\n","109: This is one of the few Asian products that are really true to size that I've bought before. I decided to go for an XL because I am chubby and in the end it was way too big for me should have gone for an L and I have big shoulders and wear bra size 38 as well as big hips too and it still fit well enough. I have a pear shaped body though but it is very true to size and fits perfectly, if you are not sure whether to get an XL or L I hope this gives people a better idea and it really does look like the picture and actually good product 5/5 would buy again.\n","110: This product came in a different colour than the one described in the picture, it was more pink rather than the red one I ordered. Almost a flashy pink colour and the material was really poor quality I honestly didn't expect it to be such bad quality, basically he colour I don't care at all but the quality was just baddd, not very stretchy at all and not even cotton very very thin fabric and just cheap, it looks very cheap in general :( I'm dissapointed because I ordered this product mostly because I thought it was better quality as well as for the color and it's just bad. Save your money, I do not recommend this product.\n","111: I ordered these for an at home beer tasting with friends. I also ordered some beer tasting place mats to go with it. This set comes with 12 cups and the place mats have 4 spots. So this set was not enough for my party of 4 to use. So I ended up using some inexpensive plastic cups that I already had on hand for one person. These cups are nice and sturdy, but they come stacked in sets of three. It was very difficult to pull them apart and one actually cracked while trying to separate it from the stack. Yes, you can wash these and reuse them, but I ended up just throwing them away. For the cost of these, I would rather just buy the cheap plastic cups that I had to supplement with instead of these. If those crack, it's kind of expected.\n","112: I ordered this set of socks for my teen daughter. She was absolutely thrilled by them. She is a huge Fall Out Boy fan and loves these! She loves wearing cute, no-show socks. This assortment has cute FOB logo designs. They are cute, trendy colors, too. The fit is perfect. She wears a size 9 shoe.\n","113: My daughter asked for new seamless underwear. I thought this was a nice assortment of neutral colors. She wears a juniors size medium to large or a misses small to medium. She's 5'7\" and weighs about 130 pounds. These fit her well and are very comfortable. They do seem a little longer than other boy short styled underwear that she has worn in the past. Because they are longer, they do hang below some of her shorts so she has to push the legs up at times. Overall, she does like them.\n","114: I can't read anything without wearing my Readers these days. I make sure that I keep a pair everywhere I might need one. I have ordered many different ones and so far, these are definitely some of the better ones. I often wear a pair on the top of my head so I have them handy. These fit well on my head without slipping down. I've had several different ones that keep slipping off my head when I bend over or tilt my head, these do not. The arms are sturdy and give just enough. The frames feel heavy duty and attractive looking. I am very happy with these! These are definitely better than the ones I pick up at the dollar store.\n","115: Plastic and all squished. No thanks.\n","116: No it was terrible.. poorly made I've seen better rings come out of bubblegum machines.\n","117: Loose and comfortable for hanging around the house\n","118: My husband loves how it fits.\n","119: I wear flip flops all the time during the summer outside, and much of the year inside my house (separate pairs to keep the floors cleaner), and am always looking for a good buy. These are good for the price and, unlike one review I read, spot-on for size (I went with a larger size due to that review and was sorry I did).\n","120: Works great but you need to keep the \"stickers\" to be able to wear them again\n","121: Love them to death#\n","122: Love the colors. Fits great and very comfortable.\n","123: I like these vest extenders using them I get so air moving through my leather vest. Can get hot in the summer wearing black leather\n","124: Perfect for keeping road dirt off your face.\n","125: soft and warm, thank you.\n","126: Stiff linen material. How can there be stretch stretch? Its linen!Not true to fit. Short in length and tiny waist for Xtra large size ordered. I have a 34inch waist. What else could go wrong?\n","127: Nice looking but too small unless you have tiny fingers and for a bonus turned my fingers black after wearing them. Obviously not pure copper\n","128: Good quality for the price. Comfy and looks great.\n","129: Great dress! Fits well , comfortable, and looks great.\n","130: Overall I like this bouffant. The fabric is thick and it is well made; it fits well. I purchased it when I was working in the COVID unit. I have long hair and throughout the day it would fall apart and feels heavy, pulling and irritating my scalp. I am sure all the girls with long hair know what I am talking about. This bouffant has enough space to fit all of my hair inside without a hair tie. Being able to avoid touching my hair in a 12-16hr shift is a big plus. However, I am rating it 3 stars... because the color faded dramatically after just 1 wash, 1 drying cycle. It's soooo faded now...I recommend this product, just avoid dark color, so the fading is not too obviouse.\n","131: Cheap quality, very small, and it took a month to ship, smells like dead fish.\n","132: Nice. Haven't worn but once. Weather here been in the 80's. Comfy.\n","133: So beautiful. Got lots of complements.\n","134: Socks are easy to put on and fit up to just below my know. The only issue i have is that for me, it can get a bit sore at the top of the sock. likely with folks with a smaller leg than mine, will fit fine and feel fine. I have to say that these do over all fit me better then any other sock i have bought. the size i used is M/L\n","135: these were a big hit at Christmas .. and great for the cold.\n","136: Fell apart after a couple washes.\n","137: Cute! But, a smidge short so it’s awkward. It doesn’t quite cover my booty. My booty is big tho. I still wear it with cute leggings, but it would look better over those leggings a smidge longer.\n","138: Fit true to size. Came with a small hole on the seam, that’s why 4 stars. Otherwise cute!\n","139: I like it and get lots ofCompliments when I wear it.\n","140: Fits like a glove, I ordered it for Wizard World. I’m still shedding the baby weight so a perfect cosplay was Peter B Parker from Into the spider-verse. I ordered a medium and at first looked like a small but I tried it on a loved it.\n","141: Great belt! Perfect way to dress up an outfit.\n","142: Belt fits well and is a fun accessory to pair with an outfit.\n","143: This is a lovely nightgown, very soft, not heavy but heavy enough to be warm. Highly recommended.\n","144: Soft, comfortable, easy to wash, sized well, highly recommended!\n","145: I loved this tee so much but when it arrived the fit and the cut was really unflattering. Cut more like a man's tee than a woman's so I had to return. Shame as the design on the front was fun and was overall a good quality item. Just hated how it looked on.\n","146: Product was as expected and delivery was quick\n","147: Just as expected\n","148: Larger than I expected. Nice for a little thought. On the flimsy side\n","149: Bought this shirt for my brother and he loves it. Said it was the softest shirt he has.\n","150: To big doesn't sit right at all paw is never even visible\n","151: These are perfect. Very easy to put in and very smooth once they are in. I forget they’re even there\n","152: This pair fit very awkwardly. Someone was in a hurry to finish sewing. It feels as though the front and back pieces were reversed in the sewing process.\n","153: I bought these as a Christmas gift for a fellow Outlander fan. She loved them!\n","154: I haven't worn outside yet, so I don't know about the waterproof factor.I usually wear a medium in men's gloves. I ordered medium and they're snug. If I order again I'll go up a size. I will edit post to let you all know about them being waterproof.\n","155: Cute, but they turn a bit on the foot. I would buy again.\n","156: I love these tops....I've now ordered 3. They are sheer which makes it more comfortable to wear in layers. For the money spent, it is a great purchase. Will probably get a couple more colors.\n","157: Description is wrong so I'm returning them, no arch support\n","158: I love the fit.\n","159: I gave 5 stars for warmth assuming it stands for coolness. Overall, great mask. My husband loves it and uses it for work every day. The elastic keeps it in place and it’s loose enough that he doesn’t feel suffocated while working in a manufacturing plant.\n","160: My breast were hanging out of the side band because it is cut so narrow.\n","161: This tshirt dress is the most comfortable dress I own. It’s form fitting but super stretchy! The material is super soft.\n","162: I bought this shirt because my girlfriend loves dave grohl, and ive never seen this shirt anywhere else. because it came all the way from Thailand it took a little longer than the impatient person I am wanted it too. BUT its awesome. I love it, and happy with it. I even wrote to the person selling the shirt to say \"hey its sucks its gonna take so long\" and they were really nice and patient and explained to me that they are in Thailand, which I didn't know. buy this!!\n","163: Fits perfect love the extra room.\n","164: Horrible, way too big for my daughter and plus when I went to return it, I had to pay an additional $25.00 to ship the return, ridiculous, waiting to hear from the buyer. Just a huge hassle not worth to me.\n","165: Really boxy fitting not at all flattering\n","166: Seems like this work's but I have to try another strength:(\n","167: I really like them,came on time and nice quality for the price would but again.\n","168: Very pretty on,made well and for the price I only wish that they had this in more colors\n","169: Omg! The socks are amazing solo! Comfortable I love the way they feel easy to put on! I'm definitely buying some more!\n","170: Can’t wait to make bracelets\n","171: Now! This is a true Green Bay packers bracelet. I was expecting something cheap. It’s not! This is a very sharp bracelet. Get It and you won’t regret it!\n","172: I really really like these. I ordered more. Too bad they didn’t have more colors\n","173: I like that they were light and the color is pretty\n","174: They weren't quality made\n","175: These are okay. Not very shinny\n","176: Very cheap. Like I got from a bubble gum machine\n","177: This is where all the cracker Jack's prizes are??\n","178: I order this. looks good but it's not . the material reminded me of the cloth you would wear like a bandage for a broken arm or something (Medium is small)\n","179: I know this isn't real. But it really looks bad. I feel like the pearl is going to fall off. I always order jewelry. But this wasn't what I expected. Reminds me of something you would get from a candy machine. Don't bother buying it save your money.\n","180: Sending back for a refund, the stone was to loose,And while I was at the grocery store I lost the stone. Other than that it's very beautiful and true to it's size.\n","181: My daughter loves it! Easy to get on and off. Easy to swim in. Perfect fit. Very modest. Would love to buy a couple more in different colors. I’ll keep checking to see if any come in.\n","182: Comfortable, stretchy, high waisted, and just what I was hoping for. Ended up buying another pair because I like them so much. I’m 5 ft 3 in and 110 lbs and medium was a good fit.\n","183: This is the smallest key chain I cannot even read what it says\n","184: Good Product\n","185: Good Product, super comfortable, light fleece so medium warmth, plenty of stretch, true to size\n","186: Good Product\n","187: Good Product\n","188: Good Product\n","189: Good Product\n","190: Good Product\n","191: Good Product but sizing off\n","192: Good product\n","193: Good product\n","194: The best features of this watch are:1. A 10 yr battery that may outlive me2. Easy to read numbers3. VERY Good illumination of the dial4. Easy to set up5. Allows me to set one screen for DST and the other for EST. I will simply push the button to get to the other time.I am a happy camper!\n","195: Worked very well for my husband and 10 year old son.\n","196: Perfect fit\n","197: Very Comfortable Light Weight Cover All. No Shrinkage After Many Machine Wash & Dryer. Great As Open Light Weight Robe Also.\n","198: This Is An Excellent Support Bra. The Extra Criss Cross give additional support in comforting way & bra is overall prettier than shown in product photos. Lovely.\n","199: Great Shoe Design. Runs Short In Sizing, Sadly Had To Return Them. I Truly Love Them. Next Size Up Won't Work For Me.\n","200: Dress For Is Good. Fabric Is Soft With Good Weight. Drapes Nicely. Color Is Saturated Well.\n","201: I love this dress but the fit was to tight around bust and waist . Order 1 size larger if you are extra blessed in these areas. I Will order again after loosing a few more pounds if it is in stock.\n","202: As a CNA, my feet and legs always ache to the point where I can't walk after a shift. That completely changed after I started wearing these! I am able to actually keep up! I wear these on the airplane, when my legs ache or when I have a POTS flare. I get so many complements on these and would totally recommend!\n","203: My daughter has many medical conditions that makes her medical team nervous when others aren't aware when she is away at college. Having this attached to her Apple Watch (40mm) makes her, the medical team and her parents feel way more at ease. She likes it because it is discreet compared to other alert bracelets she has used in the past. It doesn't bother her at all yet provides the added sense of security we need. Would definitely recommend to a friend!\n","204: Nice bracelet for the price.\n","205: These shoes ran very small. Glad the price was so low. Turns out they made a good Christmas gift. I bought 13's should have bought 14's.\n","206: Just what I was looking for! Fits perfectly. Great doing business here.\n","207: Nice quality, looks just like the picture, fits my 5 year old daughter perfectly. No shrinkage in the wash.\n","208: These were exactly as advertised. Ive had these same earrings since 2001 and when I lost the ball off of one then the ring went down the drain i thought I would never find them again but i was wrong!! Love them\n","209: My girlfriend loved it because \"it sleeps comfortably\" and \"it fits\"!\n","210: Keeps time well. I needed a clock for work since we arnt allowed to have phones at work so i keep this on my work badge and helps tell time.\n","211: Piece of crap. It looks nice in the photo but the minute you pull it out of the wrapping, you see how cheap in is. That's okay because I just wanted a cheap travel watch. The big problem is the watch loses time....about 5 minutes a day. Whoever heard of a battery watch losing time? Don't waste your time.\n","212: It's good and durable. Looks cute. The bottom button is rather high and the material is thin so definitely an item to wear around your significant other only. It's fairly forgiving. The back is perfect, even for those of us with booty. Looks just like the picture.\n","213: Very happy that I found a good fit.\n","214: There absolutely stunning! Especially for the petite eating wearer!Thank you\n","215: Bought for my niece. Perfect, now we have matching shirts.\n","216: Gift for young man who live next-door graduated high school very attractive and quite reasonable\n","217: Good quality, soft material, love it.\n","218: Love it, quality product and material. As advertised\n","219: Very thin, see-thru fabric, even though a dark print (primary color black)...heavy leotards weren't sufficient... required a \"slip\".....which made the outfit hot (102 outside- Texas Heat Wave!!).Love the print itself....but the quality is lousy, including the manufacturing of the waistband.\n","220: Very comfy, EZ fit but hand-wash only\n","221: Design is adorable but the fabrics for the bag itself were out of the industrial grade bin. The adorable cats are LOST on the rough & cheap grade fabric. The Fade-to-Gray fabric cheapens it further, & don't forget the dull Brown Straps. What a disappointment! !!\n","222: Very lovely and fashionable enough to be \"viewed\" under the appropriate fashion garment\n","223: Well made and nice looking\n","224: Under a magnifying glass, these earrings are cute! Photos in description were misleading .....\n","225: These where too big for me. I wear a 36C, and I’m a older women.My daughter is bigger busted and these fit her.She said they are So comfortable.She buys her bra’s at Victoria Secret, but now she also wears these bra’s more around the house.although for going out sometimes also..She likes these for sleeping..There made ok, but that price it is a good deal.\n","226: I was surprised when I recieved this!Shirt runs big in some places, but not in others.I bought the large, I wanted it to be big for the winter to lay around the house in for cold winter weather in California. The size is strange. I'm 5'2 136 lbs.. My daughter is 5'6 busty, and would haveBought this in a extra large, this kinda fit her, but sewed goofy, and material is awful feeling.The material is shiney, not a sweat shirt material at all, and not cozy. Sleeves are bat wings, wierd. The neck is not exactly round, and too big.The color pumpkin was not a solid color, its like a orange whiteish stripe!Sewing is not good.Not comfortable to wear.I'm disapointed and waited over 6 weeks to get this.I do not recomend this shirt..\n","227: Up-date. Beware..This shows in my size and color , Free Returns. So I took a chance and bought it. Big mistake!But when I tried to return this, now the seller wants me to pay for International shipping!!This was a 2 star, now its a One star.I called Amazon, and they took care of my refund.Amazon is the Best, that is why I shop on Amazon.~~~~~~~~~~~~The design is ok but the gray is a strange color. I can't even describe it!For me it ran big, Hugh. I ordered a large, as I can’t figure out if some of the clothes from china ,run bigger, or smaller !.I’m 5’2 138 lbs, older women, and this was too big, or tight in the wrong places!!!.Around the neck was saggy, and so was the back part of the neck..The back near my waist was sewed uneven, but in the wrong places.I have found out these tops are a hit or miss. I guess it depends on who is sewing them..Are they 10 years old, or what?The top part has No seams, its made from one piece of material,including the sleeves , very strange. The bottom part is a separate piece of material that is sewed on.I’m returning this.Btw, it took a month to finally receive this!!\n","228: Material is itchy and thin. I did not like this shirt\n","229: Good for anyone who walks unsteady or has slippery floors.\n","230: I even got a size bigger but it still was not long enough. It worked anyway but I was hoping it was going to be like the ad where she's wearing it down/over her hips. Mine ended more at the waist.\n","231: The shirt color is cute (I got navy blue) and I like the texture of material but the fit is very boxy and wide. You have to tuck part of the shirt in to make it look decent. If you leave the entire shirt untucked it looks like you're wearing a triangle...it just sort of hangs out and doesn't fot around the waist.\n","232: Wrong item came\n","233: It's nice and roomy. I have a lot of packed in it!\n","234: nicely made. fits my 4 year old perfectly.\n","235: It looks like moths already attacked it before it got here. 1 wash and it would be over.I like the cotton feel but, this is a seriously cheap sweater. Definitely wouldn't give as a gift.l\n","236: It looks like moths already attacked it before it got here. 1 wash and it would be over.I like the cotton feel but, this is a seriously cheap sweater. Definitely wouldn't give as a gift.l\n","237: This was a beautiful well made and roomy case!! It was far too big fir my 14.1' laptop tho.Lovely and professional!!!\n","238: Good casual dress. Not too short. I'm 5'2\" 110lb, I normally wear a small(size 2 dress) and ordered a medium, I should have ordered a small, it would not have been tight AT ALL. I'll take in the waist.It did not shrink in the wash, but I will leave you with this, it's not a dress for Summer time in Florida. No fabric type or wash instruction tags but it almost feels like a cotton mixed with microfiber or something. Very staticky and very warm. I'll have to use it for Fall and Spring. I paired mine with Chuck Taylor Shoreline shoes :) cutesies\n","239: Just love these! My daughter is 3 months old and the bands are almost too big but it's good because they're not too tight.\n","240: I ordered size larger, as I feel too uncomfortable wearing tight clothes. Unfortunately, this was a lot smaller than expected. Would suggest getting two sizes larger.\n","241: Keeps her pants up!\n","242: it is soft and warm and fits perfectly. washes well too. a great buy for the money. great seller!\n","243: it arrived early and packaged well this is soft, fits wonderfully.\n","244: This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!\n","245: not cotton, more likely a Rayon Spandex mix that will be HOT and therefore it's not something for beachwear in the south.\n","246: I loved the watch but the band is getting frayed and it can't be replaced according to my watch guy. Its to unusual a size.\n","247: I purchased a few of these as x-mas gifts for my hipsy friends. Its a cute, fun item but upon receipt, it really does not look as well made as in the picture. Still a fun items and worth the price! My friends all loved them!\n","248: This SKINO ALPHABET KEY RING (Letter E KK 83) looks exactly like the product page photo, and that’s a major problem! Instead of getting the key fob with a base metal “E” on a black enamel ground that I was expecting, I got a key fob with a plastic-covered PHOTOGRAPH of a drawing of a metal “E” on a black ground. The drawing of the “E” is complete with the phony air-brushed sparkle in the upper left corner. The ugly “Skino” logo is also prominent.This is the ugliest key ring that I have ever seen. (My photo makes it look far better than it really is, thanks to the sandstone background.) There is no way that I’m going to carry around a fake-looking thing like this, and it’s going directly into the trash. This is vastly overpriced (about $10 on Amazon). I would send it back, but the return shipping would cost more than it sells for.\n","249: Soft fabric. Great color. Cute style. Stretchy. Cannot lift your arms as the dress rides up. Way up. If you pull the dress down, it sits at the perfect length, however if you move, the dress rises significantly. I have to return. I am 5ft 6, short-legged and weigh 115lbs.size small. Fits as pictured, but about 4 inches shorter than the photo when you move. Might be cute with cropped leggings.\n","250: Great length! I was worried that it would be too short for me, but remarkably surprised that it’s a nice modest length falling to my calves. The white stripes are such that I would require a white slip or leggings for modesty. Neckline is nice. I wish the sleeves were 3/4, but I have a bolero and a star lace jacket I can wear over it for better mosquito protection. Have a happy 4th of July, in Freedom.\n","251: I like the idea. But, I wasn’t that pleased with customer service. I measured correctly and ordered accordingly. Placed a call twice and no one answers, just voicemail. I’d probably order again if they had a longer options.\n","252: Sadly, one arrived with a flaw. The lace is pretty, but I won’t be able to wear them to my function on Friday.\n","253: I bought this dress 3 days before prom and it came on time and exactly when it needed to be. Luckily the dress fit perfectly and was elegant and gorgeous and everything I was hoping for on prom. It's modest and has a classic beauty to it. There is lace really only on the front of it and the back is mostly just the solid color with a elegant low back (but not low enough for the bra to show). The cap sleeves are perfect and sit on a place where you don't need to worry about your bra strap showing. The only thing that I would suggest if you purchase this dress is to definitely size and compare your sizes to the charts it provides so that you can get an accurate fitting. Also, it is very form fitting, especially in the bottom area so underwear lines WILL show, so I would recommend purchasing either a thong or very thin underwear. What I did was purchase a stomach shaper that was high wasted and the leg holes went farther down to where it wasn't tight on the dress so the lines didn't show, that way you can also have a little added support and control to any tummy rolls and flatten it all down for a perfect fit. Amazing dress at a great price! Go for it!!\n","254: Comfortable without messy up your hair.Misleading ad!!! Says 3 pack in header but only only came.\n","255: Cute as can be. I had to cut 4 inches off the length because I wanted a tunic like dress to wear with leggins. I am 5' short. It is well worth the price.\n","256: Nice item at right price. Light jacket for coolish times.\n","257: I love these they are so fun to wear..\n","258: Very pretty but I don't thing it would be very strong for a heavy piece..\n","259: OK it took forever to get here I guess the seller was telling the truth about mailing it. But it really sucks it took so long I been gave up.\n","260: I am so happy with all the mid length little dresses I have purchased this season, this purple one is sassy with the ruffle hem, and cap sleeve. It even has pockets ....\n","261: what a great surprise! these are the cutest most fun ear-bobs, I just love these\n","262: These do not wear well at all. Frequent washings have left them nearly threadbare.\n","263: Thought I was getting a ‘normal’ t shirt & mehhhh. The cut is unflattering to me, it’s not as short as a crop top but for a mother of 4 It’s wide & short.\n","264: The dress fit nice and was comfortable.\n","265: Worst mask ever not breathable. Don't get these.\n","266: Don't get this if you are used to having big pockets in your coats but it is warm and cozy.I ordered a blue one but got red\n","267: This is a fantastic selection of high quality chips. The bottles are larger than most that I have purchased, so it's a great value.\n","268: These little guys are heavy duty, yet also fine in detail.\n","269: Good value for money, looks like photo, beautiful green color.\n","270: I usually wear a small (5’ 6” - 127 pounds) but the small was really big. The crotch hung low and left a lot of space. The top fit well and the length was ok but the middle was too big.\n","271: I was a little skeptical when I purchased this item. I usually don't buy clothes unless I can try them on first. I'm short and lil chunky.But when I received it, it fit and I liked it so much I ordered in another color! Very soft & comfy!\n","272: I bought these as back-up sun-Gs in a pinch when I misplaced my other pair and knew I had a trip coming up. They arrived as promised and look as presented in the pic. Very flattering. The square frames with the slightest cat-eye tilt bring nice angles to round and heart-shaped faces like mine. Great pair to have around.\n","273: Very soft material. Very flowy. It does fit larger than expected. I read this in the reviews but even knowing this it was larger than expected. I am 5'4\", 150 lb, hourglass, muscular, usually buy size 8/10 dresses and jeans and size M/L stretchy bottoms. I got a medium in this skirt and it sits very loosely around my hips. I bought it to wear over leggings in the wintertime so I am not really concerned by its looseness, but if I wanted to wear this without bottoms, I would definitely have returned this to get a small. It is a little longer than I wanted as well-- I wanted something mid-thigh or a little longer -- but I get the look that I was aiming for by pulling it up to my waist.\n","274: I was very pleased with the fit of this item however the cross straps on the right sleeve did not say where they belong. The upper cross was way too long any item is being returned\n","275: So soft and comfortable. Always get compliments when wearing!\n","276: Picture is as shown. Material is soft and comfortable. Color is as shown.\n","277: Runs short\n","278: Be very careful to pay attention to details! I thought I was ordering a size 22/24. The 24 was actually a waist size. It was my mistake!!!!! They’re beautiful and I wish I could order in my size. The only reason I gave them 4 stars was to put us larger ladies in notice that the size is in inches.\n","279: Very comfortable fits wellCan't go wrong with this brand\n","280: Very comfortable easy to wash and the length is perfect\n","281: Very comfortable easy to wash and being tall fits perfectly the length\n","282: Very good product never been disappointed fits very well\n","283: With the stores just reopening it's hard to find Capri's pajamas.They fit good very comfortable\n","284: Nice looking shirt, but wrinkles very easily.\n","285: Got for my teenage son.. got 2 pack for under $7.. and they’re worth it.. not too mention, they look pretty cool in pe class in high school- Does it get better then that? I don’t think so!! Made/wash well so far.. and used about 2 months.. definitely would buy again! Can’t go wrong for the price I got...\n","286: Bought this dress for my babyshower and it fit as expected. I'm 4'11 so the only thing I did was cut it shorter, but that was just my preference. It was comfortable and stretches too. Color is the same as the picture and I loved it.\n","287: Love the color . Lots of compartments. Zippers are of good quality. Hearty leather is softening w/use ( should withstand loads of use) makes the over all bag very heavy before adding contents. Straps are a bit to thick for a female shoulder ((have not used it as back pack yet) but the handle on the overall bags works well. Hardware adds style. Received many compliments.\n","288: Very pleased with my purchase.\n","289: Very happy with this shirt. I usually dont buy clothes online because they never fit. This looks exactly as it does in the picture and fits perfectly. I wish I had ordered two.\n","290: I am an older woman, and I am impressed with this piece, both playful and apt for an evening out against a black dress. Long enough to double up and still falls nicely around the neck. I love the Chuvora pieces, so affordable for a unique piece of jewelry. Beautifully designed and executed.ooh, BTW, the amount of compliments that I have got on this piece and now many piece of Chovura is amazing.\n","291: Perfect\n","292: Nice enough hat.\n","293: Fit right, quality fabric and good boy’s style!\n","294: Very comfortable came very quickly, but I’m going to order another pair in the future. I plan on ordering 1/2 One Size smaller because they stretch out.\n","295: Nowhere in the description does it say this is a model kit with tons of pieces that you have to put together. Very light plastic and even if I were in the mood to glue a car kit together, it still isn’t worth the money.\n","296: The propellers don’t stand erect. They fall to the side like a limp noodle. Very disappointing since I got them for a birthday party. Had to return them. The wire is too long and too bendy and the propeller and beads were clearly added as an afterthought. Don’t waste your money.\n","297: This watch does not keep time, it's really lightweight and flimsy, and broke after 4 days of barely using it. This was a waste of money. And the ring. Don't get me started on the ring. The metal coating on it was flaking off of it immediately, and it has jagged edges. Ouch.\n","298: I love the feel of this turtleneck and it fits my daughter perfectly. I can tell it's going to last a while, which is great. Even after washing there is no pilling. Never need to iron it. I'm happy with this purchase and the price.\n","299: This T-shirt has a great saying which my adult daughter will love! The quality is excellent!\n","300: My grandson loves pandas! I had to get this for him. I washed it prior to giving it to him because it smelled like vinegar. I washed in cold water. I put it in the dryer on delicate and I pulled it out before it was completely dry. Since it is angift I was hoping that it would look like new. It was pretty wrinkled. Anyhow... he still liked it because it's a panda.\n","301: My grandsons love their new pjs with sharks!!! Great fit and bright colors!\n","302: Love the style, but so thin you need to wear a slip under it.\n","303: These are the most comfortable pj's I have found!I especially like that the top is longer....which is flattering.\n","304: Decided I really did not want all of these, but waited too late to return them. Guess I can use them for gifts.\n","305: I like light sweaters in the summer. This is perfect, nice drape, will work well with some of my sleeveless summer a line dresses.Slimming, with a just a bit of a flair at the hips which I like. I’m a size 8, ordered medium, fits well.\n","306: Product is exactly as advertised. Great value.\n","307: Good quality & beautiful design\n","308: I use this when running outside in the cold & it works well to keep my ears warm. Haven’t washed it yet so I don’t know how it will hold up.\n","309: This is actually my second shirt because I got bleach on my first one. I really love the fit and it covers well in length if you’re overweight and don't like your belly exposed. I wish this came in a multitude of colors and patterns because I would certainly buy more!\n","310: Pretty cool!\n","311: Earrings were exactly what I wanted.\n","312: Love them, Comfy and great price!\n","313: I researched these wraps for a long time trying to make sure I found a soft cotton one that was comfy. Unfortunately, I chose this one. It's so big and the Velcro 8s not long enough so I can't wear. The straps are too short to wear comfortably as well. Also, I do not like the feel of microfiber because it feels weird on my skin. It is not a great product in my opinion.\n","314: When you are pretty in pink you need a pink passport cover. This one provides rfid and is cute too.\n","315: I actually enjoy these pearls! The silver chain is delicate and lovely.\n","316: These sweatpants are made of a light material, yet warm enough in colder weather indoors. Have stood up well to laundering and are economical, too.\n","317: I am 5' 8'' with a large chest (42 E). The top \"fit\", but it wasn't flattering.The back rode up and then the front sunk down. No support whatsoever.I followed my measurements to a T on their size chart. Like I said, it fit, But wasn't a great match if that makes sense.The bottoms fit and covered the cheeks, but the waistband was very tight. It pushed all my skin around my stomach out. So it was a nice tummy suck in, but everything above the waistband got all squished.So I guess maybe if you had less post baby chest and hips, it'd be a better fit hahaLoved loved the colors! So bright.I was really hoping this could be a good fit, but it wasn't. Maybe it could be for you. Just keep in mind that the waistband was VERY tight.\n","318: Bought these as a gift for grandma because we were sick of her wearing her blue blockers that looked too big in her face. These fit her glasses perfectly and now she just has to remember to flip them up and down.\n","319: love the shirt, it looks just like the picture, but the tears are a little scratchy on the skin, I recommend an under shirt when you wear it.\n","320: Synthetic sweaty material. Ill fitting. I can’t say whether this was too large or too small. Technically it fit my waist but the crotch hangs at least 10 inches lower than it should & the top is too baggy but the legs fit as they should. I generally do not have a problem finding clothes that fit online. I was offered a 50% refund if I would keep it but it’s not even worth that. I’m going to pay shipping in order to get the full refund because I can’t even regift this in good conscience.\n","321: Not the best. Too small and broke too easily.\n","322: The only thing he didn't like was no way to adjust the straps\n","323: Bought this for my Granddaughter to replace one her \"Papa\" had given her that she had lost. She said she loves it and wears it everyday.\n","324: My dress arrived and it looks nothing like the display picture. The arms had a thin piece of feathery material on them and hung awkwardly on the shoulders. The dress was not shaped as shown either.\n","325: It was damaged. The sweater fell apart because it was not sewed together\n","326: It was a gift\n","327: This is a nice fit and color and it looks nice and washes up nice\n","328: Comfortable and light. Love them\n","329: Exactly as advertised\n","330: This is a very nice wool cape. I gave it only 4 stars because compared to others I have purchased the material is very thin.\n","331: Nice soft material and color but shows muffin top.\n","332: Wash well, shrank maybe an inch in dryer but they come long so still cover to wear with leggings. Very stretchy and comfy. Colors are still good after several washes.\n","333: Went up a size to XL to fit waist of 32. Weight 190, 5ft7. Comfortable. Linen color has a slight yellow cast. Washed cool water, dryer for 15 minutes and hung to finish drying. No shrinkage or wrinkles. Not as soft as rayon pants but should soften with washes.\n","334: Super cute and so comfy. Love them!\n","335: My experiences with previous compression socks were not satisfactory. But, I thought I would give these Copper Fit easy on / easy off socks a try. (I even ordered a larger size than the chart recommended.)Well, I found these \"easy on\" socks are just as much of a challenge to get on, as previous compression socks.My guess is the Copper Fit marketing rhetoric (propaganda) will convince many others to purchase & try these.\n","336: I was a bit disappointed with the length; more appropriate for a boy that an adult.\n","337: Fairly sturdy construction. Really cute. Bendable eye stalks and claws. Folds flat for storage.\n","338: Good compression but very thick, not at all sheer or dressy.\n","339: Love them and get lots of compliments on them.\n","340: Good fit and very flattering\n","341: Its adorable but unfortunately it came broke. The needle was gone so couldn't use it. 4 stars because it is cute.\n","342: Nice fabric horribly shaped. Very boxy in the hips and bum and I have both but couldn't tell with these unfortunately.\n","343: Thin jacket but adorable. Goes with anything. It fit me just right. I love it!\n","344: Honestly I thought I wouldn't be able to fit these when I took them out of the box. Wrong, these fit nicely. Very soft and a good amount of stretch. Happy with my purchase.\n","345: Great fit. Material is thin, I wear a tank top under the dress. I bought xs, I'm 5'4\" 115lbs.\n","346: Great fit, very comfortable, I have worn twice and received many compliments.\n","347: Bought them for my son who spends a lot of time in the gym. He loved them enough to order another 3-pack in other colors. Definitely his go-to gym shirt now! They are dry-wick, with small, aerating holes in the material. They fit well and move well. He likes the deeper cut on the armholes, as well. Great purchase!\n","348: So it's a beautiful necklace and would have given it 5 stars but Unfortunately I wore it for about 3 hour's and all of a sudden it fell off and I realized the clasp broke.\n","349: The only time I don't use it is when it's in the launfry\n","350: Very pretty, and larger than anticipated. Heavy, so I would wear this on a wool coat lapel. Or a hat brim. Definitely reminiscent of the Victorian era.\n","351: Title says it all\n","352: This dress looks nothing like the picture—badly made & horrible fabric. When you try to return, company makes you pay the international postage—which costs more than the dress! Do NOT buy!\n","353: Poor quality material and craftsmanship. More like a long-sleeve t-shirt than a sweat shirt. One of the hands was sewn onto the shirt backwards! Still waiting to hear from the company on the return.\n","354: LOVE! This is my go-to blouse for everything: business meeting or meeting friends for lunch. SO comfortable and low maintenance. LOVE.\n","355: As described. Great utility work glove.\n","356: Perfect for a little princess. Great material and great fit. I got the 4/5 for my 5 year old granddaughter. She was soooo excited. It twirls, which if you have a five year old princess, you would understand the importance of a twirly dress!\n","357: These polos are cute, comfortable, easy to pull over your head, and the fit and length is great. They paired nicely with jeans. I will probably buy a few more for summer.\n","358: Perfect for my 5yr old grand. This headband is super soft & flexible. No discomfort. She kept it on for the entire visit. Highly recommend\n","359: I used this to make a 15 inch “Big Girl” necklace for my 3.5 yr old granddaughter. She loves the “secret msg” inside and the “beads”. I love the large, thick bail - so easy to add to a necklace or bracelet.I have already ordered another one for my other 4 yr old granddaughter. 5 stars + \n","360: Runs small.\n","361: Screws have continously fallen out and I need replacement screws...Are replacement screws available?\n","362: This shirt looks so cute on me! I loved it instantly. It fits really well and the material is a good quality.\n","363: It is very elegant and pretty. I love absolutely it. The words are clear and I think it makes a wonderful gift. It was packed in a beautiful little box.\n","364: Normally I am a happy Amazon shopper but not this time. My shirt came with a glaring type O stating I'm Only TALKTNG to my Dog so that tells me there is zero quality control. It's ridiculous. It's a hassle for me to return and I will NOT order a replacement. Truly disappointed. I will say the shirt is a bit cheap but the fabric is soft & if it said what it was supposed to, I would have enjoyed wearing it. Not going to happen. This was a dud purchase. I could forgive if Amazon would send me a new shirt with no type O's cause this one's on you. Shame.\n","365: Our fast growing 2.5-year-old granddaughter absolutely adores pink & when she saw her new pink shoes (size 7) she couldn't wait to wear them. Thankfully, they are a perfect fit with just enough growing room that she'll be able to wear them for a while. I was pleased to see how sturdy & well made they are, too. These shoes are a great buy for the money.\n","366: Oh my goodness, our 1-year-old granddaughter/princess was uber adorbs all dressed up for her party! \n","367: Very comfortable stretches good hold your booze very well I like the fact that you can adjust the straps in the front\n","368: I bought this for myself, and it is so pretty, and very well made. Get it, you won't regret it!\n","369: Thin, but so soft and comfy! I would recommend sizing up a size if you like a looser fit!\n","370: I paired this big beauty with a rainbow band. I really love this ring- highly recommend! Its very comfortable, and the way its cuts makes it extra vibrant.\n","371: It’s not bad quality, it just runs very small and it’s very short. It could just be me, I’m a 36 DD. It would probably work great for an A or a B cup, or someone that has a belly worth sporting...\n","372: The earrings came completely broken, no post at all. I guess you get what you pay for, junk !\n","373: I generally wear an eight, but this was so small you think it was intended to be a tight dress or something.... not a swim cover up in the least. Bummer because it’s cute, it might fit my nine-year-old niece, but not a grown woman.\n","374: I do have a big chest 36D, 140#, 5'5 The extra large was way too small, I could get it on, but not wearable. Unless you are a beanpol or teen girl, skip this one. The material is nice,, however unless it was drycleaned, I can't imagaine it would wash well.\n","375: Great quality dress. If you are a D cup or bigger, it might be a little tight, but a smaller chest would be perfect. The fabric has some weight to it, you can feel it’s a higher end dress.\n","376: Beautiful earrings-top notch quailty!\n","377: Really cute-superb quality.\n","378: You get what you pay for...It looks okay, but the fabric is scratchy. For the price, I suppose it’s not bad if you just want a new look and you only wear the blouse a few times.... I returned it, regardless of the great price.\n","379: I am not a large woman, except for ‘the DD girls.’ I bought a large, but the smooshed look was terrible. One wrong move and I may have busted out of it. If you’re bigger than a C cup, this blouse probably won’t be a good fit for you. I was so disappointed... Its a simple, yet very elegant look, and the fabric was great quality for the price. I wish they had an extra large, because it’s truly so pretty.\n","380: I love this skirt! Looks like a few hundred $ piece!, at such a great price. It is not real leather, but it sure appears to be when you are wearing it. I am going back for the other color. It's also very slimming and trendy for the times.\n","381: Very small, I would order up at least 2 sizes. However, it is darling skirt and looks much more expensive than it was.\n","382: Great quality and the royal blue color I ordered was so pretty and vivid.\n","383: Really thin poor quality fabric. Not a good buy, I'd recommend passing on this one. The picture looks much better than the actual product.\n","384: I'd pass on this one.... The material is cheap and the shape is irregular. The fit does not resemble the picture at all.\n","385: They look like plastic\n","386: Chea[p looking\n","387: Very cute dress\n","388: Gorgeous! Great quality!\n","389: Very poor quality\n","390: It doesn't look like the picture it doesn't come with the strings which want fit my daughter\n","391: THIS LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE ITS MORE OF A VELOUR THAN FUZZY. VERY DISAPPOINTED\n","392: She loves these socks\n","393: Cheaply made\n","394: These earrings are very ugly & its nothing like the picture. I wouldn't recommend these ugly things to anyone\n","395: I love this shoe\n","396: My daughter loved this\n","397: Great shoe\n","398: I love the color and how it fit\n","399: Loved them\n","400: The material isn’t what I expected. I thought it would be a cotton blend.\n","401: The sunglasses are okay. No better or no worse than competitors glasses.\n","402: Dress a little big. Beautiful dress\n","403: Runs a good two sizes too big.Not flattering at all.The pink is NOT PINK. It’s an ugly washed out pale orange.Sent it back!\n","404: These bracelets are beautiful and wear beatiful\n","405: The earrings are very well made.I hated they would never stay in place.Did not itch\n","406: The shape. I was expecting a different purple\n","407: This GH own is so soft. The color is as expected.\n","408: These items ARE NOT pink !!! They are purple . The quality is not acceptable . Don’t waste your money .\n","409: This dress is terrific. I got compliments from everyone on the elevator. Seriously.\n","410: People love these.\n","411: These dresses are huge! I ordered a smaller size and it still didn’t fit right! Very unflattering! Returned both\n","412: Such a beautiful pin!! Fast delivery with pretty packaging.\n","413: These pants are everything I love about good yoga pants with the addition of pockets!\n","414: This elevates the look of my outfits for sure. However, at the end of the day, I can't wait to take it off. It might be a bit too tight for me.\n","415: [[VIDEOID:9876547d40377bbe96a8059e72cac134]] I love them so pretty and shiny\n","416: 7.5 were too small, gave to a friend who wears size 6.5.\n","417: Washed one time, air dried and ripped.\n","418: Ugly not worth the money sis.\n","419: Vented fabrics, fits great, material comfortable on your skin, well made and the design fits your head and doesn’t slide off. My intention is to wear a face mask and also wear the neck scarf over the mask. Very good price and the UV protection is great as well. Will buy again.\n","420: Delivered promptly. I am most happy that it is titanium. Looks good on my hand. Very pleased with my choice. Since receiving this ring I have recently purchase again. Awesome quality, design and very comfortable. Thanks. Yep it works.\n","421: Really cute. Soft material, washable. I like a loose flowing long dress, bought one size up. Accessorise with light peach jean jacket. Great choice for vacation on a cruise. The colour was my main attraction. SO many possibilities.\n","422: I was very surprised they are very attractive once they’re on ,comfortable and they do not fall down.\n","423: Great just ability, good size\n","424: Wonderful material the print is awesome if it is even better thank you\n","425: Warm, fit great.\n","426: This would of been perfect to hold my mask throughout the day. I have to constantly take it off and put it on. Sometimes I put in on the floor and that doesn't help. I bought this to make things easier on me. Howver the material are low quality the straps feel like they will break. And it doesn't stay on the position I left it.\n","427: This bag is......GORGEOUS !!! Little larger than I expected, but I love it. There is a smell and I am trying what the website tells to do by putting the coffee grounds in it and it worked. I have gotteb so many compliments on the details and color.\n","428: Came on time, nicely packaged with batteries. I've been looking for a ct. scale along with grams to weigh my gemstones. Perfect.\n","429: Works good to glean and Polish silver, gold & gemstones\n","430: Does not resemble the photo in the slightest\n","431: It was way too small. Maybe when I loose a bit of weight I could fit into it. I forgot I ordered it because it too a while to get to me but that ok.\n","432: I ordered a size XL. It was more like a size XS. Couldn't come close to being able to get it on. I know shapewear is supposed to be snug, but the sizing of this product is way off. Made in China but not for American sizes.\n","433: Very happy with this dress. Not sexy but very comfortable.\n","434: The nubs on these sandals are harder than I expected, and therefore not as comfy. I did yard in them, I wouldn't be able to tolerate walking the dog in these sandals. Regular $3 flip flops yes, but not these.They do keep your foot off the sandal, if you are in need of dry feet in a moist environment.\n","435: I bought this beanie for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves the way it feels and the way it fits him! It fits perfectly over the head and the ears so he is always cozy and warm under the beanie :)\n","436: Pretty bracellet & easy to put on, unlike many bracelets.\n","437: Thank you very much I love\n","438: Notice how the cap is on a mannequin? That's because on no adult female would this cal fit as it is pictured. The reviews are either false or written by women who have heads the size of a 4 year old.\n","439: This shirt is super cute and well made. I was very impressed with the quality. I love how it fits. I'm 5'2\" and only 100 lbs so even a size small is often too big on me. This short looked like it would be too big when I first opened it, but after trying it on I really liked the way it fit. It is loose fitting and very comfortable. I love the sleeves and the design on front too, and it happens to be my favorite color! It's super cute to pair with either jeans or leggings.*I received this product for free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion. All thoughts and words are my own!*\n","440: Bought as a gift for my mom. The queen bee loved it\n","441: Love this looks so sparkly\n","442: I really love this purse. It is small which I like but still carries all the items I need. The gray color goes with everything. I'm very happy with my purse. If you want a small purse without a million pockets, this is the one for you.\n","443: not as expected\n","444: The fabric is slightly sheer so I'll wear a cami, and it has a nice drape. It fits but if you want a loose look, (like on the model), order a size up. The rosey colors are not bright so it looks delicate. It has a casual look yet, it's very feminine, too. The gathering at the neck line is elastic so it gives it some shape. I like that I can wash it and not have to iron it.\n","445: Bought as a gift for a friend living in a cold and damp climate. I chose the Klimt based on the reviews and I'm sure it'll look good with her more muted color scheme in her home.\n","446: I love these and own three pairs!!\n","447: Nostalgic! Just as described. Very good chain.\n","448: The shirt is way too small, i recommend going up two sizes if you buy it. It doesn't stretch or anything so it's hard to take off.\n","449: Very nice fits great. Very comfortable!\n","450: Perfect. My daughter loves them. They are easy to get on and very warm.\n","451: Exactly what I expexted\n","452: It is cut on one side, did not fot well and looked horrible\n","453: Absolutely wonderful feel and weight. Cozy. It was just too big for me.\n","454: Stitched together well. Bright. Great price.\n","455: I LOVE these rings! The feel, weight and quality is awesome, no defects and highly recommend!\n","456: Comfy light and pretty\n","457: My grandson who is 16 is still hugely into anime. He is going to love these rings as a Christmas present\n","458: I was a little hesitant at first because it doesn’t have a collar, and it’s partially cotton, but it comes up high enough so that you really don’t need one. It’s a really nice sweater, and it’s warm enough too.\n","459: Nice to wear. Show off cat pride\n","460: Works great for virus protection\n","461: These are the most comfortable socks I have worn.\n","462: the top does not sit still and you will flash people\n","463: really delicate and nicely made\n","464: comfortable no front or back so no uncomfortable feeling if you put it on wrong. Strong and lovely.\n","465: I will keep this, but again not a very good fit\n","466: Great pair of cuff links for my husband.\n","467: So small. Tiny is more appropriate. Feel like it's more of a child chain. Disappointed for a special, not wanting anything more from this maker.\n","468: Great fit. Comes to my knee. Long enough shorts underneath. Not too thick and not too thin. Cute colors and pattern.\n","469: Really nice set of face masks, styles for both me and my hubby. Plus they are bigger so they are not always pulling on your nose. Just remember to hand wash them!\n","470: Easy to wear, dress up or down. Extremely comfortable. Have not washed it yet...we will see.\n","471: They work for me when outside doing gardening or watering.\n","472: very easy to put on\n","473: Love these, soooooo comfortable!\n","474: I was afraid it was going to be small but seems to run true to size.Im a 2x and the 2x runs true to size\n","475: Beautiful but very large.Not heavy.\n","476: Would not fit an 8 year old girl.I orders largest size.Cheap material.Too smal. Sizing a joke.\n","477: The size small frame fit my muggle wife quite nice.\n","478: Love them! The calf area is perfect and the foot area is a little big but I just wear my hospital socks, thick with the non-slip on the bottom, and it fits fine! I've used them every time I go outside and they work perfect! Sand and rain are no match for my red boots!!!!' Really happy I can garden and not destroy my other shoes!\n","479: These were for my son and they fit great. He seems to really like them and they look awesome on him. They got here quickly, seem to be holding up really well and are easy to clean. I will definitely have to look for more pairs in different colors. Thanks!\n","480: The size seemed to big and overpowered other charms. And the tiny ring on it broke within a few hours. Not impressed with this one.\n","481: Weird pockets.5\n","482: Took a while to get here, but it’s VERY nice!!\n","483: Runs small\n","484: Very please with these bags. Holds lots of groceries. Very sturdy.\n","485: The teachers loved them! Best gift this year! According to the kids their teachers put them on immediately lol\n","486: I’ve ordered several of this style dress in different prints and this time I decided to go with the tie-dye and it is a totally different kind of fabric that is a little more slinky and form formfitting/stretchy. This particular one is my favorite! It didn’t shrink a bunch when I dried it. The color is vibrant. The fabric is soft and not cheap feeling like the ones with print designs. I’m going to order more of these in solid and tie-dye colors.\n","487: Not bad if you like cheap polyester. Amazon should stop allowing these products on their site.\n","488: This product is a pure fraud. The quality is substandard, it comes in child sizes even when ordering a large and XL. (I'm medium btw) it is definitely not like the photo. This is the same super cheap crap you find on wish and I would not recommend this to anyone.\n","489: awesome flower girl gift\n","490: The outfit is good quality but, after a few washes, the material starts getting little balls all over it. Also, I suggest sizing down if you like a more fitted look like the picture of the model. I ordered a size medium I am 55 and 140 lb. The fit was quite loose, more like a large.\n","491: I am happy with the look and quality of these earrings. They will be just darling paired with just about anything. Gives you that POP of red but, not too much!\n","492: Cool looking and comfortable as well as durable. Holding up nicely 6 months down the road! Great purchase.\n","493: Absolutely adorable! My grand daughter loves them.\n","494: These are super cute and lightweight so they are extremely comfortable. They are larger than a normal safety pin but still cute!\n","495: So cute and comfortable! Will go with everything\n","496: I’m a size 8/29 in pants and normally a medium or large in dresses. I ordered this in an XL and it was too tight. The material wasn’t as expected, it felt like a weird windbreaker material and there is no stretch at all. I returned it because I wasn’t looking for a bodycon dress, but if it were true to size it would have been cute\n","497: I ordered a medium in these and I’m normally a size 6-8, I’m 5’1” and I was worried about these because of my pear shape and bigger butt. As far as size goes, they do fit as expected, if you’re closer to a 10 you might want to size up - because they have two zippers on the hips and it might be tight. Giving this 3 stars because the quality is definitely a cheaper material, although very soft and stretchy, they’re really thin and I don’t see them lasting years and years. Also, the front pockets are great, but the liner on mine shows very easily. Also, the waistband on the back wasn’t sewn down so I need to tuck it in and be conscious of that, which is a bit annoying. The length is great for me, but if you’re tall, listen to the other reviewers - they’ll be too short on you. I could wear these with heels or flats without hemming them. Great for the price though!\n","498: The fabric is that weird wannabe chiffon and does not look like the model at all.\n","499: These gloves are just a little too long for my hand. They are very warm, just a little long for my hand\n","500: bought 2 pair,fit good ,black& white.both came with front button broke or missing\n","501: really poor design,bad fit,just put in garbage\n","502: A family member asked me to order this for her since I have Amazon Prime. As always, it arrived on time and was packaged well and in perfect condition. About a week after I gave her her bras, I checked in with her to see how she felt about them so I could review them. She said they are 'FANTASTIC' and they fit well. She was so happy that no wires dig into her and her breasts do not pop out of the cups like they do in some of her other bras. She found them to be extremely comfortable as well. When its time for me to buy some new bras for myself, I'm definitely going to give these a try. The price is beyond amazing!\n","503: I have stretched ears, which isn’t a problem, but these hoops hang awkwardly and aren’t wearable.\n","504: Super small, tight and short!\n","505: I love Tyvek and Dinomighty but this pouch is a bit oddly shaped, very small and not very useful. Super cute though, mine holds mints in my purse.\n","506: Boss is Roll Tide Roll and a golfer! Perfect gift! Excellent quality; very lightweight and moisture wicking fabric. He was very pleased!\n","507: Really?! It’s the size of a silver dollar. I have to actually shake it for it to come on. It lights its immediate surroundings and NOTHING else.\n","508: Havent actually printed picture out yet. Bought for nieces wedding. For her bouquet. That was her grandpa can be with her on her special day\n","509: I needed this shirt as part of a work uniform. Usually an XL fits perfectly. However, not this particular item. Either it runs very small or it shrunk during shipment!\n","510: You get what you pay for ugh\n","511: I got countless compliments on this stunning Christmas pin. By far the best of the 4 I had ordered for Christmas.Feels like jewelry.\n","512: This material is simply too light for the attractive style. The shaping is good, but it's a bit big and so not attractive.I'm 5'4\" and 163lb - could have sized down. Not sure I'll ever wear. Cannot return as I live on an island. Pity.\n","513: I love the fabric of these Max Studio tops! The body is waaay loose though, so I ordered XS when I'm really L. The colour is a bit drab, so I've been having a ball dyeing them in various colours. They look amazing. I have at least 10!\n","514: I love these earrings. So classy! I ordered them in the middle of a pandemic, expecting to wear them - where???Not sure.All I know is that I'll be wearing them the next chance I get. Maybe next week they will help to jazz up my mask-look!The size is modest. They are light-weight and comfortable - totally stunning!Glad I didn't go with several other less expensive options.I will enjoy these classy earrings.\n","515: These are soft and stretchy, but the legs are just TOO TIGHT for the size - cheapens what could have been a great look!\n","516: Very cute shorts, but definitely not for larger girls. Legs are a bit narrow to be flattering. Nice quality!\n","517: This top really looks more expensive than it is. It's much cooler than expected for my tropical climate and is an easy, casual look. I ordered it in 4 colours - all were great except the red - closer to burgundy which I don't like.Order your regular US size\n","518: Very slimming style, but the seam around the round neckline spoiled a great look.\n","519: This is a 'body-con' outfit.Do not order if you have anything to hide.Seriously, I'm thinking one day I will loose enough weight to wear it under a dressy duster jacket?I live on an island, so returns are hard.In the meantime, it goes into my 'waiting' bin\n","520: This is a well-made blouse and the fabriv drapes well. I followed the measurements and ordered my correct size ( scroll way down under the item to see specs) It fits as per the measurements, but this tyle of fabric looks better a little loose.Definitely going to order more colours.Without pockets looks more expensive I think. I shall get the lighter colours with pockets to hide my bra a tad and wear more casually. Not easiliy wrinkled.I'm delighted\n","521: Was shocked at the quality here. I hate wearing gowns to formal occasions, so was experimenting with jumpsuit options. Slightly large, so will have it altered to take out the pockets. Hopefully, it will slim my silhouette some.Fabric is quite thick. Nothing sleezy about this! Great\n","522: Very nice fitting. Only cons are the zipper is made with cheap material and the outfit is a little thin. I have had several times where I had to refeed the zipper back together. Otherwise this is a cute outfit.\n","523: They were big for my face so gave them to my mother she liked them.\n","524: I am using this with the yahaira happy butt no 7 works fantastic. Is a must\n","525: I received \"blue\" and could have sworn I ordered \"black\". Keeping them tho . . . Too much of a hassle to send back.\n","526: Excellent quality, can't beat this deal for the price!\n","527: Smaller then it appears and the chain is short. But over all still a nice crystal.\n","528: I love the lotus flower. However I think the chain is a little shorter then 18 inches I purchased a 20 inch to go with it. Other then that it is gorgeous.\n","529: Just as pictured and comfortable. Great for the wood worker in my life\n","530: You get what you pay for. First of all they’re not big....the ones I got did not look like the two toned ones I ordered. They’re flimsy and cheap. I have them to my 10 yr old. Not what I expected.\n","531: I like this a lot! However it does run a little small. I normally wear a size Large and I ordered a XLarge and I’m glad I did. It’s very nice and soft and a perfect length. It is also the perfect weight for me as I am always hot so it nice to have a lightweight sweater to wear.\n","532: Nice fabric,a bit large for a small fellow\n","533: The panties fit, comfortable fabric.\n","534: At this moment I am wearing a pair of these pants I purchased at a big box store in Navy color at least 2 years ago or like $12 bucks. Same pockets, same style --- exactly. Not 1 lint ball, not 1 tear. The only place where there's obvious wear is at the bottom, rear heels area. (And for that area, I always spray with some Shout before I throw them in the washer). In the years I have had these pants I have probably washed them 100 times. THEY ARE AWESOME. So awesome in fact, that they are my ever go to. I wear them outside in the yard. I wear them for quick trips to the shopping. They still look great and hold their shape! I thought, \"They're getting old and you wear them so much you better purchase another pair now.\"Now to this new purchase. First, it is next to impossible to find them online and in the stores. I know because I have been trying. Second, I paid twice the amount of money for this new pair (which is NOT ALL THE reason I am giving this product a 1 star. In fact, if they were of the same quality as my first pair I'd gladly - as demonstrated - paid twice as much with zero complaint and a 5 star rating). BUT THESE PANTS ARE CHEAPLY MADE!!!!The material is so cheap and poorly made... so awful. I've washed them twice and they already have those unsightly lint balls! I don't get it. They look exactly the same but for the color (because NAVY was sold out everywhere). My level of disappointment in Eddie Bauer is beyond description. It is at a level that the brand name means poor quality to me such that I will never buy anything bearing it's name. When you have such a respected brand name, smart manufacturers guard their quality at a nervous, OCD level. Not Eddie Bauer. If you've been looking for a second pair of these pants, just be grateful you have 1 already and go to another brand.\n","535: Lightweight and keep my feet dry. Good support without being overly stiff.\n","536: I gave the Teal 5 stars because it is unique - it was not as pictured, it was a light teal with swirls of brown - but after putting it on the chain, it looks great. I Highly recommend - each slice is unique\n","537: Can't say enough about this bracelet - comfortable, adjustable for smaller wrist. I have purchased more for gifts and everyone - from tween on up have loved them.! Beads are just as pictured. Highly recommend!\n","538: returned it\n","539: These really do help with oncoming traffic headlight glare, i use them when I have to drive at night.\n","540: I like the band, but it came with a face plate to match the band that was entirely to big. So pretty much I got a band only. I sure I ordered the right size. My other bands were fine.\n","541: There a tad thigh so of course I were them under a large shirt. Good quality and very soft.\n","542: couldn't be the price and their very pretty!!!!!!\n","543: Great quality leggings\n","544: Too small..\n","545: Looks nice! The leather could be better quality, it feels a little cheap\n","546: I loved the colors but this band kept popping off of my wrist. I wear exam gloves and a lab jacket most of the work day and I would feel it pop off and be laying in my jacket. Even days when I’m sitting at the computer or playing with my toddler, a sudden motion of my wrist and the band would unclip from itself.\n","547: I got these for my husband who mountain bikes 3-4 days a week. he loves them!\n","548: Didn't work on a ring that I had lost that was Sterling Sterling that was very tarnished. Tried multiple times and returned.\n","549: Beautiful watch, horrible craftsmanship. It broke right out of the box. Contacted customer service, they were \"out of the band\" and said I would have to wait \"several days\" for a replacement. Then I didn't hear back from them as to if or when they would be replacing it. I would save my money and buy a kid's watch at Walmart.\n","550: Smaller than what I wanted,but good bag.\n","551: Mine weren't broken went I received them but the nose grips keeps falling off.\n","552: Very comfortable!\n","553: Well, I have more curves than this dress will cover.\n","554: The seam on one of the legs started to come undone after only 1 wear and wash. I bought a few other pairs and had no issues with those ones.\n","555: The collar was wider than I thought it would be, so personally didn't like it but it fit fine.\n","556: Read previous reviews that said to order larger then you normally wear. I usually wear a small but I ordered a Large and it fits how I wanted it to\n","557: the balls are barely held on I was hoping they screwed on but they are just pinched in there if ring flexes you loose the ball would not recommend\n","558: Size up if you want the lose for like the picture. This is form fitting at TTS super cute shirt and it is thin. I like it\n","559: Love these shoes!\n","560: Love them\n","561: After reading reviews, I ordered 2 sizes up. There is not a lot of support, when I lay down or lean forward, they fall out.\n","562: Very pretty earrings! I like the concept of the screw on backs, however they do not screw on far enough. With just the screw on back, the earrings hang from my ear and get caught on my hair, I put the plastic spacer on, then the screw on back, they fit a lot better.\n","563: I ordered the size I get for similar products, I was able to get it on, but it was very uncomfortable. Also it rolled. Perhaps in a larger size I would not have either problem.\n","564: Love them\n","565: It is the exact color as pictured, the material is ultra thin ! I thought it was a jogging outfit but I was wrong . Size is a bit bigger than you order , just keep that in mind , it's a baggy fit .\n","566: Great buy at a great price and they were packed great!\n","567: Love these fit great and works as described\n","568: Very cute and soft\n","569: I bought this in a medium for my very picky 16 year old daughter. I didn’t have very high expectations because she didn’t pick it out and usually doesn’t like what I pick out. I must say I was surprised when I first saw this sweater. It looks and feels like a sweater that would be in a boutique. It is a good weight and soft...great quality! To my pleasant surprise, my daughter loves it too. She wore it with high waisted jeans with the front of the sweater tucked in, and it looks really good on. I would definitely buy this again!\n","570: Better quality than expected and very cute!!\n","571: Nice comfy light weight t-shirt, took almost a month to get, due to being shipped from china, wore twice and probably won't get many more wears out of it due to already pilling.\n","572: I was looking for a gift for my brother who loves wildlife, incl moose. It came packaged perfectly and was a very good quality product. Looks like it costs much more than it actually did. The company is the BEST in regards to customer service. They actually emailed me after shipping to me and told me that shipping didn't cost quite as much as they had estimated, so they were crediting my Visa for the difference and they did! That is the type of company I want to deal with. I will certainly shop with them in the future and would tell everyone else to as well.\n","573: wasn't what i wanted\n","574: Perfect in every way. Thanks\n","575: Was not comfortable\n","576: No elasticity, poorly made & almost see through!I returned them ASAP\n","577: This is more a designer hoodie. I would need to order 2 sizes bigger to fit into one because it's not a normal hoodie. It's soft but again very slim and not stretchy at all.\n","578: I haven't gotten a chance to wear this watch yet, but it looks amazing. I love the sleek black look it has and look forward to wearing it.\n","579: I LOVE THE COLOR!!! The fit is perfect for me and i look forward to buying as many as I can\n","580: Beautiful color and quality but smaller than I imagined\n","581: These shirts are expensive but they wear like iron.\n","582: These are OK. Comfortable.\n","583: Another favorite Hanes seamless wire free bra, love the colors and the fit. I own several!\n","584: These sunglasses are stylish alone and fit over my Rx glasses perfectly if I should wear them that way or wear them alone. They are very light and fit nicely, no slipping. They fit so comfortably, not too tight or too loose. Recommend these glasses and the price is right!\n","585: I do demo work in grocery stores sometimes near coolers or the front door with cold winter air blowing in. This shirt has lots of body with a somewhat thicker knit fabric. I bought a large size, as sometimes medium can be too tight. It fits perfectly, and didn't shrink when washed. The sleeve length is perfect. I am going to purchase another.\n","586: I’m 5’2” and the small was a bit longer than I wanted. The bottom skirt part flares out (like an “A”) too much for me - I wish it was cut to appear straight down. It makes my hips look too wide. Luckily, I sew, so I can make this adjustment to make it more narrow. I was a little disappointed in how wrinkled it was after a first wash, but my trusty iron will handle that. Overall, a cute and inexpensive outfit.\n","587: I wish these pants were available year-round. My husband lost weight and we needed to go one size down and were only able to find 2 pair of these pants by ZeroXposur. He needs six pair for work so I am trying to find more in his size before the fall.\n","588: I got this for Christmas from my husband, but I picked it out. I did replace the necklace due to it only being a 16inch I think (maybe a 17). I needed an 18inch. Beautiful necklace though\n","589: Fit as expected, perfectly. Material strong but comfirtable. Elegant lace, not cheap. Absolutely fabulous! Im 5'6\", 175lbs. Very voluptuous. I can wven use thus dress without a bra, thats how supporting the material is!!!\n","590: Its obviously not silver. Didn't expect it for the price. Nobetheless, its pretty and big. I thought it would be smaller.\n","591: I bought 2! I have grandchildren that come to our house to swim. I like to have suits on hand and these fit the bill! The tank style is much more comfortable and there is no pulling or tugging or adjusting. They are also comfortable enough that they jump out of the pool and onto their bikes without changing! These are also made of sturdy fabric so they should hold up to wear and tear easily. I would definitely recommend!\n","592: Nice ring but colors are a little deeper than in pictures if not in direct sunlight\n","593: Great gift for my Grand Daughter\n","594: Great fit, sleeves are a little long\n","595: My husband couldn't get it going so we worked together to get it set up. Beautiful Watch!\n","596: Had to return, didn't fit\n","597: This top runs small. I got one just like it from a different seller but with long sleeves and it fit perfectly, so it's frustrating that two shirts that look almost exactly the same and say the same size are in fact different sizes. It's too small to be comfortable so I'll need to lose a few pounds for this one if I'm going to wear it.\n","598: Love these jeans\n","599: Very light and nice to wear\n","600: Soft and wonderful feel\n","601: I don't care for the bulkiness of the clips. I was hoping for something a bit more \"dainty\".\n","602: These are adorable shoes and I would wear them with leggings any day of the week. They seem to run just a tiny bit small so depending on your shoe size, you'll want to be mindful of fit. I ordered a 9.5 but returned for 10. All good!\n","603: Excellent fit and looks nice.\n","604: Fits perfect. Looks very nice. Drapes beautiful and if you accessorize with a complimentary broach, it's a new sweater altogether!\n","605: I could have found better at Dollar tree. Definitely not what i expected. Looks nothing of power rangers. Very cheaply made.\n","606: Cleans shoes\n","607: I love my sweater. It's exactly as pictured. I bought purple and a size down so it would be more snug, it is very, very warm\n","608: I am very happy that this beautiful blouse fits me. I am a size 12 American. The chiffon ruffle is beautiful. The sleeves are a little short, as I am 5'8\"inches. The fabric is different and synthetic. It works beautifully for my Christmas caroling costume as I have a cape to camouflage the fabric\n","609: I love them but I expected them to be a tad larger.\n","610: Love the army green color. Very soft and comfy. I am 5’4 and this hit about my hips.\n","611: My company color is orange. I saw a fellow coworker with this dress on & leggins. I had to order it. I’m a DD chest so everything fits snug up top. But the dress is comfortable. Hugs the waist & flows out.\n","612: they fit great\n","613: For a quick band to switch out while dressing up my other half loves it\n","614: A little bit small but good\n","615: I bought my daughter and son-in-law steam punk items for a fun night out. This hat fit perfectly.\n","616: Needed a second pair for around the house.\n","617: When is China going to get pur sizes right?\n","618: I get compliments every single time I wear this. I thought it was just a comfy sweater but it's so much cuter in person.\n","619: It was gorgeous for vacation, but it gave me problems and turned green.It kept getting twisted which would cause my belly button to bleed even though I've had my piercing for 4 years. I haven't had this problem with navel jewelry since I first got it pierced.Also, like I said, the jewelry started to turn green after a couple of months. It really irritated my belly button, and I've never had that problem with other jewelry.Seriously doubt it's actually surgical steel.3 stars because it was really cute in my Instagram and Facebook photos for my FL vacation.\n","620: These r adorable. I've bought these 4 two baby showers and the babies have worn these on every occassion. Both babies are still wearing and into 9 and 7 months from birth.\n","621: I bought this for my husband. His original CIB is put away for safe keeping. He commented that this pin is the correct blue color (apparently some are to blue).\n","622: I bought one of these helmets for myself. My husband tried to \"borrow\" it, but it was the wrong size. So, I had to get him one! He's very happy.\n","623: loved these for my work boots! fit great...wash up nice. I usually wear 2 pair of footie socks from another store and now that I got these only need 1 pair for comfort\n","624: Comfortable and nicely made!\n","625: THIS IS THE CUTEST LIL RING ESPECAILLY FOR THE PRICE.LOVE HOW IT DIDN'T COST MUCH AND I WAS JUST ABLE TO ADDIT TO ANOTHER ORDER WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL SHIPPING & HANDLING FEE\n","626: I bought two dresses the same size. One fit perfectly but I could not get this one over my head. The other one that fit-the stitches were coming out. I returned them both. I am leery of buying now because of the inconsistency. I am sad as honestly I wanted them all.\n","627: What an unexpected joy. These masks are not only stylish but quite comfortable. They fit nicely under glasses without the fog up. I have gotten so many compliments on them. I tell everyone they need to get them. The adjustable ear straps are a bonus. Might just be my favorite purchase yet.\n","628: These are absolutely precious on my 4 year old! I got a matching pair in my size and I must say, we rock them. They feel durable and fit as expected.\n","629: This is an AMAZING suit!! I am so glad I ordered it. I am 5ft 4in and 125 lbs. I ordered a Extra large because it said order two sizes up and it fits perfect!! I feel so confident in it.\n","630: These are perfect googles! My son loses several pairs every swim season, and it was getting way to expensive to replace them all the time. These are great, work just as well as the expensive pairs at a third of the price!\n","631: Bought this pajama set to wear during my stay in the hospital when having my daughter. I didn't get them out until at the hospital and there is a hole in the pants! It's now too late to return so I'm stuck with them.\n","632: I took the advice from other reviewers, and ordered a 1/2 size larger than my typical size. They fit perfectly! And they are super cute!\n","633: I did not like the material the color was unflatteringI usually buy extra small. I’m 5’ 96 lbs and medium was way to tight\n","634: I’m 95lbs 5 foot 32B bust. The small fit me just right.I like the light weight fabric perfect for summer I recommend this shirt. Well made. Stitching is good qualityI also like the shirt goes down below my hips.\n","635: I’m 5 foot 95lbs. I bought a medium. Works well for me as u can see in the picture”s.I recommend buying this shirt. For the price and delivered to your front door I highly recommend...I’ve boughten quite a lot of tops from patty boukit over the past 9 years and I truly love this one the most\n","636: I’m 5 foot 98 lbs and usually wear extra small but this shit was too tight in chest and arms. A medium would work for me.The color is a bit drab sent back.\n","637: Nice quality for price\n","638: Really cute chunky necklace, perfect way to dress up an outfit. Arrived really quickly too.\n","639: Love this hat, purchased one for my daughter and son. She was able to wear it until she was about 5. Love it because it adjustable head size and truly holds the hat in place in the water and a great sun protector. They wash well and hold there color for hears....worth every penny!\n","640: Started with black..added this blue one. VERSATILE COMFORTABLE AND WEARS GREAT.\n","641: I really like these slippers. I wear them inside and outside. Very comfortable. Would have like more memory foam to last longer during the day, but it is sufficient.\n","642: Loved this so much that I bought one for myself and one for a friend. I would say that these cuff bracelets would fit \"most\" wrist sizes, but if your wrist is especially large I wouldn't purchase it. It's not meant to completely enclose your wrist, but rather to be open an inch or so in the back.\n","643: Nice gift!!\n","644: So great!! My guy likely.\n","645: Ankle is highly. A little bit uncomfortable. But nice design!!!!\n","646: Shoulder & backline fit a little big.But dress up. doesn't matter. Look is nice!!\n","647: Very colorful, bright and sparkly crystals. Own several of these and will most likely purchase more.\n","648: I LOVVVVVE these shorts!!! They fit perfectly...very true to size. Even better, there’s no real stretch built in so they hold things in place. I just bought another pair.\n","649: Bags are large and hold a lot. Very sturdy.\n","650: Bought them for my husband he loves them.\n","651: I bought two of these, in black and yellow. They fit very well, easy to button. The material is very light, which is what I was looking for. Color is beautiful, garments seem well-made. I am very happy with these sweaters, and would highly recommend.\n","652: Smaller than expected. Order a size larger. My son seemed to snag them pretty easy. Not sure if that’s the shirt or my son’s fault. Nice value.\n","653: We bought these for my 6 year old who said he wanted something for his ears so he didn't have to hear the baby crying. lol. He does really like them and it doesn't hurt his head. It is adjustable in size. My only complaint is trying to get them to stay unfolded. They fold automatically and will not stay open unless they are already on the head.\n","654: very cute, although it was a little small.\n","655: Love these they are really comfy!\n","656: Very nice. Changing strap configuration didn't work properly (straps and band buckled when criss-crossed). Lace overlay is delicate it's definitely a hand wash item.\n","657: Its a good size! Very nice!\n","658: Love it! All my cards, are in need order. I don't have the worries that I left a card behind.Every card has a slot. The cards that I don't use all the time. I put them on the other side. The key holder is great for my second set of car keys. Lots of pockets. The long strap is great for food shopping. There is no need to put your handbag in the cart. Which is great security wise. I like the soft lining in the bag. And I use this for work and everyday usage. It has really held up. Just an outstanding bag. Thank you! FYI It took a long time to get to my home.\n","659: Great value for money. Fots on wrist\n","660: Gaming hat for the roblox gamer in your life. She loved it.\n","661: Bought to wear under my sweaters. Love them. Fit perfect. size is as expected.\n","662: Fit great. Quality fabric but the hood does not come off. Trending style for teens at half the mall price.\n","663: Very thin and a very shinny---looks a little cheap.\n","664: Love it\n","665: This hook is larger than expected, but other than that great necklace at a great price.\n","666: I love these earings. They are the perfect size and don't weigh too much. In fact they are routinely stolen by my 60 year old mother and 25 year old sister.\n","667: These were a hit with the kids, but the plastic is brittle and breaks easily.\n","668: These are defiantly not the same quality as the real smith lenses. They are much lighter and have a more plastic feel. The mirroring is not as dark which means people cam see your eyes through the lenses when in direct sunlight. That said the lenses have a nice coloring and are very clear. I would buy these lenses again especially because Smith does not make these glasses anymore. That said the\n","669: A nice sugar free addition to the Halloween candy bowl!\n","670: Love the look of the shoe. Can wear them about a 1/2 day before they hurt my feet. Very stylish!\n","671: This was very pretty. I read the reviews and bought a size bigger. I wish I hadn't. It was too big.I have an hour glass shape and this dress was not flattering on me.\n","672: Great bow tie and color..\n","673: great product and looks good worn too.\n","674: My grandson loved these pajamas! Catboy is the current favorite!\n","675: These are so pretty and do not weigh down my earlobes. Like the way they sparkle too. And they will not tarnish!\n","676: These are too small, the material is thin and cheap, and the storage bag is not attached as other bags used for grocery totes are. I don;'like them.\n","677: Very scratchy and hard lace.\n","678: Super nice quality and in a set of four pairs too! I recommend.\n","679: Cte, but took a very long time to ship.\n","680: Very nice. Very nice, indeed!\n","681: Junk. Garbage. Spray painted plastic trash.\n","682: Kinda stiff. Knee length. Not that soft\n","683: item very heavy and slides to front of my neck all the time, and necklaces still tangle\n","684: Love these luggage tags. It all, I have purchased about five sets of this type from this company. Quality is excellent for fake leather, and the older ones I have have stood up well too many trips through the baggage carousel.\n","685: This cape is everything I wanted. The weight is not too heavy, not too light; the drape is beautiful; the interior finishing is perfect; and the color is a gorgeous hazel that complements almost any outfit.Some reviewers have expressed disappointment that the cape is not of a heavier fabric. Please keep in mind that full, long capes like this involve a lot of fabric – – if the fabric is much heavier than this, then the garment is overwhelmingly heavy. Also keep in mind that this kind of shape allows you to wrap it around your self sort of double if you are cold. It also allows you to wear a layer or two underneath in colder weather. For this reason, I adore this item for travel to changeable climates. And it looks amazing with tall boots!\n","686: Very cute, with a quality look.\n","687: Nice, inexpensive birthday gift for teen girl. Teens love things that are personalized.\n","688: I gave them away because even with the stretch they wouldn't fit. I ordered a size bigger than I take and they were still too small.\n","689: This was a great bag, but it ended up being too big for what I was looking for. I feel like the measurements in the description were off slightly and I also gauged the height of the bag wrong. Outside of size, this seemed to be a really nice purse and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something in this size range. Item was returned but because of the quality from the brand I intend to look for another purse of the same brand.\n","690: Arrived well packed and on time. Good quality for a fair price. My only complaint is that they're smaller than other readers I've bought - I've attached a photo of the round rimless with a pair of cheapie readers recently purchased from my local Wal-Mart. I'll keep them and wear them anyway - I can live with the small size and will update my review if they don't survive.\n","691: Love my band. Easy to put on my watch. I get lots of compliments on my pretty watch band.\n","692: Love this sweatshirt, its very comfy. I wasn't sure of the sizing so I went bigger to have it loose but its a little too big so I don't think you need to size up for it to be loose fitting.\n","693: Love this top. Fits well and good quality. I would recommend.\n","694: Very nice shirt, fits well and is comfortable. It definitely doesn't look like the pic on me but still nice. I would recommend.\n","695: Fit is pretty good, ran a little small. Looks good and is very comfortable.\n","696: These are very nice earrings. Not as substantial as I had hoped but they look good and I will wear them.\n","697: Great sweater. Fits well. It did shrink a little when I washed and dried so it lost a little of its \"looseness\" at the bottom. It still fits and I will continue to wear.\n","698: Great bag. It is a good size, it is big and holds a lot which I like.\n","699: I love this jacket. It was exactly as described. It is quite loose as noted, it is not a fitted jacket. I found that it fits just as it looks in the picture.\n","700: Great robe. Very comfy and roomy. It is soft and a perfect weight for a summer robe.\n","701: This is very nice! Very soft and comfortable too. I got complements on it the first time I wore it!\n","702: This is a pretty shirt. Cool for the summer and looks cute on!\n","703: This was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loved it!! So do I!!\n","704: I could have swore I purchased a different brand, but no matter. The material is great, so soft, nervier wrinkles. The fit is perfect. The length is right at the ankle and I am 5’9”. So it’s perfect.My only drawback on these pants would be the pockets. They are odd. They are not placed well or the shape is wrong. They do buckle a bit which I do not like. I am not a fan of pockets any way and these are just not flattering. I am a seamstress as well and I will figure out what is wrong and correct it. Other than that the pant fit well.\n","705: The color is love, a muted pink shade. The blouse fits fairly well except the sleeves rug short and the waist is large. The size charts is off.\n","706: Fits way too large around the waist. It the material is lovely. The dress flows and drapes well. I hand washed this dress and hung to dry it came out well. I am going to try and wash in on the delicate cycle in the washing machine and I hope it doesn’t pill. Will size down with next purchase.\n","707: Cute cami. The armhole is a little long, but if you adjust the spaghetti straps too much then you lose the lovely V-neck cut\n","708: Fit my granddaughter perfectly\n","709: Beautiful color. Size is right on, no wiggle room.\n","710: A great shirt but the sizing is weird. Does not fit the U.S. size chart. My husband is 6’1” 160 lbs. and I ordered their size Large and it fits perfectly. Hope it doesn’t shrink when I wash it.I wish these companies that want to sell their product in the U.S. would get a clue and use the U.S. standard sizing. This would cut down on disappointment and costly returns and delays. Anyone agree give a shout out\n","711: Great sock for low rise boots\n","712: First of all the mentioned elastic at the waist is not there you will find it just under the boobs. Not what I wanted. I expected to have a dress that was a little more form fitting instead of a 70 year old in a maternity dress. Think about it. It gave me a laugh. But with these foreign purchases you never know what their English translation will mean.\n","713: Like B. Unique. The only problem with This pair of shoes is the strap was very very short.\n","714: Too much material in the front of pants\n","715: I ordered the purple color but when it arrived it was more of a reddish color. Not what I needed\n","716: I wanted this dress so badly but the fit is awful. I believe the size chart needs to be reevaluated.\n","717: Too small in the bust area. Too small from the top of the shoulder to below the bust. Gave it away instead of returning it\n","718: Does not stay in place, even with the anchor tape. Priced too much for the poor job that it is supposed to do.\n","719: Nice print, fits well but the shirt material could have been better quality.\n","720: Makes my husbands jeans look like they’ve been to the cleaners!\n","721: Awesome quality\n","722: Absolutely Love This Coat very warm and the 1 thing that I really love is it is 2 Jackets in 1\n","723: This is perfect as a liner under another coat when incredibly cold outside, or use in milder weather by itself.\n","724: Use this for a key to my shed, looks great.\n","725: Bought an XL. Just barely fit over my chest and is very short plus tight. Was told I looked like I was wearing a kids shirt.\n","726: It smells so bad and is way bigger then it looks. Also hard to get cards in and out. I would not but this again.\n","727: Does a good job for the price.\n","728: Besides being pretty it covers my face more and more efficiently than standard masks. Adjustable ears straps easy to slide and they stay in place. Would buy again. Very nice product.\n","729: This hat is adorable, made very well and I imagine very warm. BUT it is definitely made for a child. My head measures 21\" and I could just barely pull it down to my ears. The color is pretty but not as vibrant as my monitor shows. This will go to my 9yr. old grand daughter.\n","730: Beautiful and of good size and quality. I did have to buy a chain extender but that is no big deal. Received it quickly, wrapped securely. Will buy more jewelry form this company if they ever become available.\n","731: Gorgeous pillow of exquisite quality.\n","732: Very impressed with the comfortable fit! Fabulous colors and fabulous seller!\n","733: Too tight.\n","734: the scarf is very nice and soft...full size\n","735: These are lovely. Just what I wanted to match a necklace.\n","736: It comes as one solid piece. Less connections to break. Bought for a kid joining the military. He loves them.\n","737: This natural stone bracelet is looking amazing! I like the light blue color and it’s great for daily wear. It’s fashionable and it is comfortable to wear\n","738: I got this bracelet for my mom and she loves it! It’s beautiful and each stone is well picked. And the design is amazing! It goes with all her outfit!\n","739: The tote bad is beautiful! I love the color very much. It’s not Snow White but has the nature of white in it, which is chic. The bag can fit in anything I carry on a daily basis. And the design is amazing!\n","740: Pretty comfortable and stylish shirt. I like the blue color and strap design. The fabric is a little stiff, which is the reason why I give it four stars only. Hopefully it will get softer after I wash it.\n","741: Love this fashionable Japanese style shirt. The design so detail oriented, and it looks so nice on me! Love it!\n","742: Love this crystal watch, as it looks so expensive and good quality. It is beautiful and elegant! My mom is very happy about this order!\n","743: This shirt is very stylish, and it fits me very well. The design is fashionable, and perfect for the work out time. It stretches very well and feels totally airy. Love it!\n","744: Love this 100% cotton shirt. The fabric is such great quality. The true red is very appleaing! Love it and can't wait to wear it when I go out!\n","745: It is a very affordable watch, but it does look expensive. The design is simple yet sophiciated. It will match all my outfits. Love it!\n","746: I recently want to try some classic streetwear. I got these pants and love them. The color is very fashionable, and they could go with any shirts and footwear I have. Cotton blend material is comfortable and airy. Overall, these pants are amazing!\n","747: I live on Oahu, and the rainbow is common to be seen here. I got my mom this rainbow bracelet and the design is so cute and gorgeous! It is light and fashionable.\n","748: The robe clung to me and was too small. I threw it away cause I can't return it. I am so disappointed.\n","749: Gave it away\n","750: I would not buy again.\n","751: Weird fit. Decent quality\n","752: Returned this because it was too stretchy so it was too big for me.\n","753: Didn't care for this style. It was snug as are most Wacoal bras.This style gave me a somewhat \" pointy\" look.\n","754: Does the job. Fits my large calfs quite well.\n","755: The fit was perfect and they feel very nice and soft. Just used for wearing around the house. Some have complained that they are transparent but mine are not at all.\n","756: I like the design of the pendant !\n","757: I like the design and intricate detail I wear this with anything in my wardrobe\n","758: This was advertised as an XL hat. It was so tight that it was uncomfortable, and I don't have a big head. I returned it.\n","759: Very comfortable and warm for wiinter. Ran a little big, but the length is nice and long to keep your backside warm.\n","760: Love these earrings real easy clasp you do not have try to catch it in back just hooks snaps worth the money.\n","761: I've bought these several times now for party favors, stocking stuffers, easter happies, and to send to school for class \"treasure box\". Fun and a great bargain!\n","762: I bought two of them. They look great, wear well and at the same time bought my son an Invicta for $85 he wanted. This watch is better looking.\n","763: just what i wanted\n","764: Husband warm for a Halloween costume – he was Granny that the wolf ate\n","765: Seem \"cheap\". Way small\n","766: I'm only 5'4'' but this comes above my knees - and I don't like that. I'm going to add lace or a layer of fabric.\n","767: I truly love these earrings.. color is soft and beautiful and I am very happy with them and highly recommend this dealer.\n","768: Great handkerchiefs. Good designs and a generous size.\n","769: I had to return these because I couldn't get the collar to lay down, the collar is cute up, but it drives me nuts.The tops are really well made, I bought blue and red, I wish they had worked for me\n","770: My husband uses these to keep facemasks on because they're more comfortable than traditional extenders. Has used them for sunglasses also\n","771: This is my fav hat. So inexpensive and cooler because of the light coloring\n","772: Very comfy\n","773: Perfect!! Comfortable, lite, fits like a glove...\n","774: It was exactly as promoted and displayed:) Recieved as agreed!!:) Easy to order:):)! Exactly what I needed...\n","775: Very nice for a graduation gift!\n","776: Very soft. I like it a lot. Perfect length for me (and i'm 5'5\"). After wearing again, I realize that it does run a little small. Not enough for me to return it, but definitely order a size up.\n","777: Nice bag, but the only downside are the zippered sections on the front. I find that they really do not want to open, the zipper sticks and doesn't want to open. When I persisted and got one side open, I found you really couldn't put anything in there anyway - it's too tight. As decoration, it adds to the look of the bag, but I was hoping for a usable outside pocket.\n","778: Great for the price.\n","779: Color was as represented. Fit and length was perfect for me. Would buy again.\n","780: As always Patty Boutik doesn’t disappoint but this has got to be my favorite piece of her’s so far. The material is SO soft but not only does it fit z woman’s body perfectly but the contrast stitching outlines my silhouette magnificently. I have now bought this in 2 colors for my daughter in law and this is my third color. Good thing I see lots of different people so they don’t get tired of seeing me in the same (different color) all the time because I always feel fabulous and can count on at least 1 compliment with each wear! Love Love Love!!\n","781: This mannequin works great. Allows the jewelry to be the focal point and almost faded into the background verses the standard black mannequin. I will purchase again.\n","782: The shirt work rate. Our daughter is in the 40 percentile for her age so she is on the smaller side. Because of this the shirt was a little long. But it still looked wonderful.\n","783: Worth the money, but pretty cheap looking.\n","784: Brought 2 different colors. Yellow and Green durable and easy to tie. Soft. Totally recommend\n","785: Sizes were ridiculously small, I returned all. Very Cheap quality.\n","786: Comfortable slipper. However, the back is not that high and crushes down while wearing. Simply put, the back should either be high like a full slipper or totally eliminated like a slip on to be more comfortable.\n","787: It works, but you have to be faithful and use it regularly. It does what it suppose to, it even fits good under garments! Which I really like.\n","788: I ordered what I thought was the appropriate size using the manufacturer's chart. It was so small I couldn't possibly try it on..\n","789: Very nice and well made pin.\n","790: Good pressure\n","791: Not as described at all. This shirt can NOT be worn off-shoulder. The neckline is a standard t-shirt fit and it does NOT have bat-wing sleeves. This is basically just a plain white tee and 100% NOT what they are advertising. Super disappointing.\n","792: I love these glasses! The red is really cool, chic & flattering! They are VERY sturdy & well-made. Like the tortoise she'll too. There's something for everyone's taste. I know I'll wear every pair. They grey is really nice, sort of a transparent grey-blue which is beautiful. Then there's the standard black, which you pull off & look so very good lol.I highly recommend the case. It's really well made, has a cleaning cloth & is very versatile, attractive & sufficient to protect a pair carried in the depths of my purse. It is black with a large band of red down the top. Of course there are different colors available, but I'm very apply with the red & would buy it again & recommend it highly. I love that I could get the coke bottles that I need to read 5.0 & they don't look like coke bottles. All in all a solid hit. Love the. Oh the lenses are very clear, like crystal. Love love love!\n","793: Ok, I read every review for these earrings & i have to comment. First: they are big: yes they are! They are very big! Is that a surprise? Shouldn't be! Just look at he dimensions! They are that big! It shouldn't be a surprise! I love the size! I am a judge Milan fan; check out her earrings & she is a classy lady! Second: cheap appearance. They DO NOT look cheap for the price! In fact, it's quite a feat to create such nice looking earrings for sooo very little money! I am not going to wear these to a big formal affair (although I would not be ashamed to do so( but I will wear them pretty much for everyday, lunch with friends, shopping visits, doctor visits, etc. third: they are too heavy! O my i must vehemently disagree! These earrings are very light & cause NO discomfort at all! I am exceedingly sensitive to heavy earrings. These earrings, surprisingly are comfortable enough to sleep in and are whisper soft. I have. No problem with a review that accurately reflects the cons of a piece. However, none of the complaints listed herein accurately reflect the problems of these earrings. I have tried to completely & fairly represent these earrings. They are very inexpensive , but you get a lot of bang for your buck! I DO wish Amazon would give us some choices! At least 10k maybe 14k since gold prices have dropped so significantly! Are you listening Amazon buyers? Also, bring your prices back down to a deal cause you now cost significantly more than the products available in local stores!\n","794: Bought as a gift for my Mom and she loves it. Thumbs up!\n","795: The orange is more of an 'electric salmon' - a smidge of pink undertone, not a 'safety orange' hue.The green is exactly what I wanted; my kid is obsessed with this color. He's a mens 7.5 and these are really almost too short/small. I've stretched a tiny 'run' into one on the first attempt at putting his socks on him. I'd definitely say these are sized more for womens feet, specifically the typically smaller womens sized feet found in the country of manufacture (the average womens shoe size in the US is either an 8.5 or 9 and in Asian countries I believe i read it's more like a U.S. 5 or 5.5.).Can't comment on the compression value unless they calculate compression value with algebra, spandex percentage and the foot size the socks are manufactured for \n","796: This was the first time I used these elastic watch bands. Super comfortable. I use it to play tennis. Fits the watch nicely. However, it does show dirt. I haven't washed it yet, but assume it's going to come out.\n","797: I love these! I have many of them in different colors\n","798: Love these crazy round oversized pink sunglasses! So much fun to wear!\n","799: Cute scarf. I wear as a scarf and use as a belt.\n","800: So I loved how these looked, and the fit was perfect, however two of the butterflies gems just fell out after wearing them a day or two. They were not expensive so I'm not really complaining, but if they just held together my rating probably would have been 5 stars\n","801: Great thin undershirt. Fits snug and good to work out in and wear in general.\n","802: I ordered these for my Mom; she had no idea how to use them and neither did I. I'm returning them\n","803: Husband loved it! Very Nice belt\n","804: I love the idea of the necklace but it's just weird. It doesn't lay flat across my chest and the ribbon started to fall apart the first time wearing it. Awful!!!\n","805: love these glasses!They are actually my 2nd pair, I bought my first pair @tylers. They are awesome quality and durability, they stay on while I’m playing sand volleyball; they are also very light. I also like the nose piece, it does not leave prints on my nose or get stuck in my hair when I rest my glasses on my head.\n","806: Watch band started losing color within 1 week of having. Terrible quality and color isn’t as vibrant as discerned.\n","807: LOVE IT\n","808: So I read that these run small, and therefore ordered a 40, whereas I'd normally go with a 39. Glad I sized up, my toes had just the right amount of room. They are surprisingly comfortable, especially the nicely padded insole which actually offers a bit of arch support. I guess it's the knit sock, but they feel nothing like you'd expect plastic shoes to feel, and that's good! That said, they still LOOK like jellies in that they're kind of shiny. That shininess kind of turns me off, it just reminds me of galoshes or something. I'm keeping them because I desperately need some flats that have arch support, but I don't think I'll order more - just not my thing.\n","809: Great product!!\n","810: This is a nice product, but I am not convinced that I \"love it\" yet. It makes me look pregnant or that I am trying to hide my belly. Of course, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just get self-conscious with no \"form\" to the bottom of a shirt. I needed this for a trip I am taking and it seems like it would dry easily, so I will take it with me. But I plan on sewing the neckline in a bit, it's too open for my taste, so I will sew the bottom of the V together about an inch or more, as there are no buttons. The material is not thin, seems like good quality.\n","811: This pendant was lovely, shiny and larger than I thought, but the person I gave it to was happy. It is closer to being the size of a nickel than a dime.\n","812: Sized up but it wasn’t enough. Returning for a bigger size\n","813: Though these are incredibly pretty, I didn’t realize they were not internally threaded (which is what I was looking for). I got caught up in the barbell on each side and the color lol. Good product though\n","814: I’m a curvy girl and these fit great\n","815: I went up two sizes and it's still a little small. I also wish there was a little more fabric on the bottom to give it more of a romper feel than a onesie.\n","816: Great colors, just thinner than I'd like\n","817: Pretty well made. I wear it every day and it is only just starting to show wear on the edges after about two months.\n","818: It came jus as it was suppose tood\n","819: I ordered several items to help my mother-n-law after elbow surgery. Most worked, a few needed to be returned and this was the only one that would not allow me to return it, even in a pandemic and the package isn't opened. Can't tell if it was a good product, but an expensive one if you aren't sure.\n","820: Not much more to say. These were a great find.\n","821: This dress is see thriugh. The fabric is thin and very poor quality.\n","822: It is a nice simple scarf that accents what you wear without over doing it.\n","823: I love this! Mine got really shiny shortly after wearing it. It draws a lot of attention i get a lot of compliments on it. This is a great piece to have if you are looking for a piece of jewerly to wear all the time.\n","824: I first worried about it being a fake because I have real moldavite that pulsed in my hand and got hot within five minutes and I didn't feel that. After about twenty minutes I felt pulsing that went into my chest then spread into my shoulders. It is thin I am afraid to drop it because it will break. I am sadisfyed with it over all.\n","825: This is a gift for my mom. She loves larimar.\n","826: I bought this for myself and another for a gift.Very loose but I only wear around house so no problem.\n","827: Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my granddaughter. She loved it. However, it did not work. Window to return has closed. Waste of money!\n","828: Looks great with jeans or leggings and I am tall. Hits me at thigh level.\n","829: I am tall and this dress did not fit right. It is too big in the top. And I am chesty. In order to get the chest in the right place, I had to pull the halter straps tightly then the waist band was under my bust.\n","830: Bought these for my granddaughter and she wore them once. The size is a bit small. No padding in the back of the heel and the shoes rubbed blisters on her heels. Luckily, she was at summer camp and changed into her flip-flops. Promptly went into the Goodwill bag.\n","831: Stone is loose and rattled when worn\n","832: looks very cheap\n","833: Just what I expected for my wallet.\n","834: Very nice quality. Nice size. Lovely gift box. Worth every penny.\n","835: This product is a hoot!! It is so funny-looking that my grand-kids pretend they don't know me when I wear it fishing. It is fairly cheaply made, but I think it will be okay if I don't treat it too roughly. And on top of all that, it does the job! I use it mostly for shade, and haven't tried it in the rain. I love that I \"take the shade with me\" when I am wearing it. Sometimes I wear it while working in the yard. Great idea!\n","836: This is a very heavy weight warm sweatshirt! I've had it for a year now and it has held up great! I hang it to dry... I ordered it huge and it has stayed huge and wonderful. It's my inside the house where I keep the thermostat at 65' survival garment. I can pull the sleeves down over my hands - at the same time the cuffs have enough elastic to stay in place if I push the sleeves up.\n","837: measurements in size chart do not correspond with product measurements. beautiful pajama set, however. Deciding whether to return or gift to someone.\n","838: These are great for summer wear. Look nice and comfortable.\n","839: Could be cut a little wider but nice\n","840: Threw it away, fabric cheap.\n","841: I bought these shies for my grand daughter and she loves them!\n","842: The fit was not ad expected\n","843: They are long and fit perfect\n","844: looks great, very small size.\n","845: The fabric was very soft, and the colors were true to the picture. Purchased this as a gift, and it was very well received! Gloves and hat both fit as expected.\n","846: Decent dress, needed a significant amount of altering upon receipt. One of the two came with what looked like an extra boob cup sewn below the two cups. So, since neither my friend or myself have 3 breasts, one of them had to be removed at our cost to make the dress wearable.\n","847: Was not expecting to have to do watch band surgery when i ordered this band. The material feels lovely against my skin, but the entirely ineffective instruction card that came with the band is telling me to fit the band to my wrist by cutting off chunks at a time and replacing the metal clips. Unless there is a YouTube tutorial where i can see what needs to be done they seriously need to reconsider selling these online. They need to be sold in a store where someone trained can size the band for you.\n","848: I have only worn it 5 hours but the comfort is like any other ring. It is exactly as pictured in the description. The fit is perfect, so go with whatever your normal size is.Can not speak to tarnishing or greenfingers yet, but it looks lovely on the hand! I will update this if any issues occur.\n","849: I didnt lay it out perfectly in the pic, but the product is as shown. I usually wear a Small (am 5'4\" 117ish lbs) but got a Medium just in case it shrinks. Without shrinking its a little baggy but not enough that it looks silly. Overall, worth the purchase, as this price rocks compared to other online sellers selling the same cardigan for more!\n","850: The fabric is thinner than id thought. The colors are also brighter than in the picture-- more vibrant/bright than the jewel toned rich colors they had appeared to me in the pics above. Is as long as id thought tho-- im 115 lbs 5'4\" and Small hits right above my ankles.\n","851: Very pretty!\n","852: ****UPDATE****In my initial review(below) I had given these high marks and five stars. Today, upon trying on my second pair (in black) I downgraded these due to lack of consistency.I initially got the faux snake style. Different color but same shoe. However, the black ones are not nearly as great. The sole feels like a regular shoe not anywhere as soft cushy and comfy as the first ones I bought just a week ago. Disappointed.**********************I am still in awe of how these work.I feel like I just bought magic shoes!I have not been able to walk like a normal human for months now...I reluctantly ordered these sandals.After having spent a small fortune on a sleep boot, plantar fasciitis socks, foot insoles, cold packs, cold socks, warm socks, special running shoes, etc nothing even touched the pain. Zero relief with all those things I bought before.These shoes. Magic.\n","853: For school play.\n","854: Horrible shape... makes you look like your nipples are showing... or like you have 2 on each side, dissappointment... Don’t waste your money!\n","855: I have already noticed that my feet sweat significantly less when I wear these socks. I have no idea why, but the claim is true for me. I accidentally dried them and they did shrink but I have really small feet.\n","856: If you like Buff, do not expect these to be the same. Much thinner. Fit is not as good nor as nice in feel. If you want cheap. This is your deal.\n","857: I really like chokers to dress up casual jean outfits. I only tried a few of these, but every single one broke as soon as I clipped it on. They really look nice, but are not durable.\n","858: I had a necklace that was too short and this worked perfectly to extend it.\n","859: Nice feel but a little larger then I expected. Since it is compression I thought it should have a tighter fit.\n","860: Very attractive looking glasses, seem to curb my eye strain from hours of video gaming and/or using my laptop. I even like to wear them when I'm not using screens as fashion glasses. They fit both me and my husband and are of a good quality- I'm not worried about breaking them with every day use.\n","861: I got so many compliments it's ridiculous! Flattering for any body type as the empire waist it's super dramatic but does hide any potentially bloating, neckline is not too low, & length is perfect. Split in the middle is not drastic so it does not fly apart easily but if you are looking for your leg to show even when not walking that will not really happen. Would buy in all the colors!\n","862: This dress is so cute & fit perfectly however the split in the front is dramatic so if you're not paying attention & a good breeze kicks up you may be showing off a little more than planned... Proper undergarments are a must!\n","863: They do not keep feet as warm as hoped.\n","864: They fit as expected and look great. They are strong for leggings.\n","865: It is made pretty well\n","866: LOVE these earrings! They are really pretty, not too large, not too small, and really fine craftsmanship! Am planning to buy a couple more pair as gifts for the holidays.\n","867: Love this!!!!!\n","868: I ordered one of these tops as a gift and upon seeing how well the product fit, I ordered two more tops to use as gifts. Good choice of color combinations as well.\n","869: Within 2 weeks and 4 days of wear the watch completely stopped. I am majorly bummed because I wanted a decent looking pocket watch but should have realized that this price to look was too good to be true\n","870: I returned the watch did not like it. So I sent back the band it fit good and was a good band but would not the other watch I got.\n","871: Good leather a little stiff at first but it is breaking in fine, good leather is that way.\n","872: Have this to my boyfriend and he loves it.\n","873: Ok first when I opened the box I noticed they were bent. I have some m readers that are,great much better than these. They are,cheap made flimsy. Small at least compared to other reader.\n","874: My husband is a non-sadal wearer and he wore these comfortably. However, they failed to make an avid sandal wearer out of him.\n","875: Good QualityAs describedBoyfriend loved as a valentines gift!\n","876: Really nice . I love it .\n","877: Very nice ! Love it .\n","878: My daughter really likes it.\n","879: The color is more of a peach color instead of pink. It wasn't actually what I wanted.\n","880: Was shipped faster than the original date, outside package well done and protected. Upon opening the envelope, I found a gift box but when I opened the box I found a small 1.5\"x2\" envelope with the necklace inside all tangled and knotted up which took me over an hour to get all the knots out. The heart is pretty but a lot smaller than the picture makes it appear. Chain so delicate and clasp so tiny it would be difficult for a normal person to put on themselves or someone else. Very easy to break the chain due to it being so delicate. Chain in ad states a length of 17 inches but when I measured it , I barely got it to reach the 16\" mark. It looks more like something a child would wear but is far to delicate . I am not sure whether I will spend the money to return it or just keep it and call it a loss. It is not something I would ever buy for myself as if it ever caught on something, it would not be worth repairing if it could even be done.\n","881: Great product Great fit. Sizing is perfect\n","882: The necklace itself was pretty. It certainly didn’t look real, but it has an interesting shape and sparkle and makes for a nice statement piece. I think it will look nice up against high necklines of a solid color or a lower neckline just against your skin, check the length to make sure it will hang right.The reason I knocked off a few stars is that The one is received was broken. One of the smaller side chains that connected to the outter most chai was broken and hanging. I considered keeping it and fixing it (I probably could have re-attached it with glue), but it’s ridiculous to spend money on something that is broken. I’m not sure how durable the piece is, so that may become an issue down the road if you purchase this. If you happen to get one that is not broken, it’s quite pretty.\n","883: I ordered this dress in yellow for Easter Sunday. The color was gorgeous. It is a nice bright and sunny yellow - just like the picture shows. The problem with this dress is the fabric. If it had been a bit thicker, it would have been perfect. As is the dress is a thin spandex feeling material - picture thin workout leggings. This makes the dress cling in ALL the wrong places. It literally settled into every bump and crevice on my body. Spanx could not salvage this dress (you could see every spanx line too!) This went back post haste. I suppose if you go up a size or pick a darker color, it might work....\n","884: Item is shrunken sizing. Way too short and way too small. Child size chart is not accurate and should be be banned from marketplace!Very deceiving! Causing a purchase that you have to PAY TO RETURN!!! Useless item!\n","885: Purchased for my 92 yo mother and she loves them. What is shown is what you get.I am a little concerned about the very thin necklace. I think it could be a bit thicker\n","886: These bracelets are perfect for friends. They’re so nice and they’re easier to adjust.\n","887: It didn't work when I recieved it.\n","888: They are sturdy, but light weight. Color is spot on.\n","889: fit perfect! Wear a M and ordered a M. They actually stay on when I bend over and are not see through. Very warm too. Bought 2 more pairs\n","890: just fine - finally found what I was looking for\n","891: Boots arrived in great condition and fit wonderfully!\n","892: Great value and easy to attach.\n","893: very comfortable\n","894: Love these just wish I could find more in the low cut like these, so tired of boring white socks\n","895: These goggles are great! they are very well made and the optics were exactly what I was looking for\n","896: Lightweight, great for a quick trip out/to the beach. If you dont like the tag it comes off easily and doesnt leave a mark\n","897: Greta wardrobe addition for travel. I am not the type to like not wearing socks with sneakers etc, and these are a great compromise, covering up to the ball of your foot, they eliminate heat and friction I would otherwise experience without socks. great buy\n","898: Bought as a gift and he really loves them.\n","899: This was an impulse buy but boy! did I make a good impulse decision!! The kimono is absolutely gorgeous! I love the black and gold color. I think I'll wear the black side out, I think the gold side will startle my roommates :-).Very comfortable. I am short a 5'4 guy and the length is perfect for me.I wish it had a few different options to tie the loop, right now, there's only one belt loop.\n","900: Very hard to screw end on. Screw come loose then lost.\n","901: I received a pair of boots that were purchased on line that were supposed to be dark brown, and were not. I contacted the company about the mistake, and if I could replace the boots. Apparently the supplier had gone out of business. Rather than accept the refund, I decided to die the boots to the dark brown color of color of Kelly's Leather Die and the Nugget Brown Cafe to get the desired result, I was looking for. It worked!\n","902: The material inside the shirt is extremely itchy to me even after washing. Had to return it.\n","903: I found the inside material to be so itchy. I had to return it. Also, a small would have fit me better.\n","904: Cute, fits great and very easy to care for, I definitely suggest you buy it.\n","905: Very affordable but I regret the purchase just was a bit flimsy. Would be awesome for a little teen. Overall its cute. Probably wont last or for certain will get lost in a pocket never to be seen again....\n","906: Arrived on time. I'm a RealTree Girl & I love jewelry so this is the best of both. Pendant is a very nice size. The neon green is unique. The cord is sturdy. I think I'm going to buy the blue one, too. Definitely recommend.\n","907: THE BEST HEADBANDS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. I have already ordered them twice. They last SO long and I get compliments on them every single time I wear them. I've worn them to workout, to swim, to spray tan, and everyday wear!! They hold up for so long. I will continue to re order\n","908: The hat is quality, but it looks like a typical baseball cap when it is put on. ! was expecting something a it more classy for the money.\n","909: It looked cute online, but was terribly unflattering. Runs small. Returned.\n","910: It is ok.\n","911: These sandals work quite well for relieving the pain of Diabetic Neuropathy and Arthritis. They are comfortable to wear, although not made for walking in. The conductive probes relay good stimulation from the TENS unit with the use of conductive gel or spray, and the pain relief lasted for several days in my case. There was strong stimulation of the calf muscles in both legs which resulted in a complete cessation of night time leg cramps. I have heavy scaring and calluses on one foot, but the multiple conductive probes of the sandals were able to work around this problem. I highly recommend these sandals if you suffer from Neuropathy in your feet, or Arthritic pain in your toes or ankles. Blessed relief!\n","912: Warm and comfortable!!\n","913: Fits perfectly, a great cross between professional or casual and very comfortable without being too clingy.\n","914: returning. Too big, one size down too small ..this one has a huge elastic twist there's no fixing except paying for alterations. Amazon needs to stop this 3rdparty cheap app junk. Disgusted. Measurements didn't match at all either\n","915: Excellent watch. Handsome and extremely accurate. It looks more expensive than it appears to be.\n","916: Sturdy wallet, but with just a few cars it is quite thick.Wallet should come with money so we know what it looks like inside the wallet and how to keep bills sorted.\n","917: Pretty outfit\n","918: Easily dresses up or down. I wore it with a blue buttonless long sleeve sweater. It was a fun look tying the corners of the sweater up around my waist, but wore sweater down for a casual evening look.\n","919: Easily organizes everything, expedites transactions as everything is visible and easy access. Love it!\n","920: She loved it.\n","921: See through tight and uneven in some areas not a nice product\n","922: Very cute swing dress but no cotton blend, it's polyester. I love the shade of deep green, it's very flattering. I prefer to wear with leggings.\n","923: The sleeves are too tight on my arms and I was expecting a cotton blend fabric. It's polyester and not stretchy or breathable. It's super cute otherwise so apple shapes with thin arms will love it.\n","924: These are better than under armour highly recommend former under armour wearer best value also.\n","925: The hat came with the brim wire broken. It was floppier than I expected, so I returned it. The flower detail was cute.\n","926: Cheaply made, but lovely design. The first one I revived had bubbles obscuring the text, but I was promptly sent a new one. Great customer service!\n","927: I sent it back just because its brim was too wide for me; even with the front folded up, there was just too much brim. Otherwise a good quality sun hat.\n","928: Just what I needed for a trip when I didn't want to take my big purse but needed to carry credit cards, driver's license, other ID, + my reading glasses. Great quality and stayed pretty flat even with the glasses in it. I'd buy it again.\n","929: This looks nothing like the picture. I should say the fit is nothing like the picture. Decent quality sweater but HUGE and not cropped or baggy in the cute oversized look sort of way just wide and sloppy looking.. sent back.\n","930: Stiff, stitching nothing like the photo and overall just kinds cheap looking..\n","931: Not as cute in person.. The color was a bit dingy looking and more old fashioned looking than trendy. Material was decent and not see thru. I sent it back but I suppose if it was worn with the right shoes and accessorized it could be cute. I just found it a bit too boxy and overall not as cute or flattering as pictured. I ordered a small and it was a bit big but fit fine I am about 5'5 and 128lbs.\n","932: I am 5'6 and around 126 lbs and (almost) always wear a small in dresses, esp flowy/loose style ones. So I got a small in this and it was too tight across the shoulders and bust (I am 34-36 small C). Nice material and color though :) Sending back for medium. Love the neck! And versatility to be dressy or casual.\n","933: Super cute, nice quality material and not see thru or sheer like many comparably priced (t-shirt type) dresses. My only complaint is the pockets, most seem to like them I think they are annoying and the only unflattering part of this somewhat form fitting therefore flattering dress. I like how this dress is loose yet has a bit of a shape and not so \"box like\" or \"maternity\" looking. I am almost 5'6 and weight around 130 maybe just under and a small is perfect.. it's also a lot longer than the picture almost too long for my personal preference but not quite.\n","934: I was not sure if this would stand up like the ridge. I can say it has and meet every expectation. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great front pocket compact wallet.\n","935: Great pants..... Keeps the wind off your legs, plenty of pockets, awesome product would buy again. Idk how quick they'd dry because it has some cotton in them but it's a small amount anyways so it should dry fairly quick.\n","936: Love this nose ring. The bendable aspect makes it perfect.\n","937: I thought it might be too small but took a chance. It's fun, well made and soft. Just not large enough for my huge melon!\n","938: Smokin' deal! Got a few to hand out to homeless this October.\n","939: Very cute for the price\n","940: Bought it for my buddy. Loves it. Very colorful. Dancing at the grill!\n","941: Look nice for the price but very very small.\n","942: Wrong size does not stretch much either.\n","943: Love them!!!!\n","944: I love these shoes, I bought them in 3 colors. they are very comfortable, and true to size.\n","945: ADORABLE..... Fits perfectly. Pants size 3 & small top size & I got an XS & it fit great.\n","946: Very expensive...Beautiful card though but got a generic envelope...not the one pictured in advertisement.\n","947: Great fit, great value. The case was exactly the right size for a pair of prescription Ray Ban glasses. When it arrived, it had some sort of glue on the case--looked like perhaps the glue used to attach the liner seeped out onto the case a bit. I was able to remove it, gently, with a cloth and warm water.\n","948: Coarse material. Barely got over my head.\n","949: Love it.\n","950: Really cute necklace, just right\n","951: Husband loved them, warm and toasty\n","952: It’s $30 for an amazing dupe. Get it now before it’s gone.\n","953: I bought this as a birthday gift for my grandson and he absolutely loved it. Useful and great value for the money.\n","954: I love these socks. The color is perfect, comfortable, and I love the quantity.\n","955: These are sized small. Definitely step into these when trying on. EDIT: Customer service contacted me regarding my return of this item. They are very helpful and concerned with any problem you have and willing to send a replacement. Unfortunately they do not offer an xl size. The garment itself seems to be well made for the thin frame. CS contacted me a second time with another style in an xl size. I received it today and I am very pleased.\n","956: I have lots of hair and its waaay too large\n","957: Its an attractive and well made shirt. Has a slenderizing effect\n","958: Shoe laces have no extra length to be trimmed to the proper size and then put the metal cover on. Even if I could trim them the screw and screwdriver they send with the laces don’t really match up well and it’s nearly impossible to see what you’re doing anyway even if the screwdriver wasn’t slightly too big for the screw. It’s a good idea. Not executed well at all.\n","959: does exactly what it should. goes to the knees. will buy again.\n","960: I love these! They are a perfect fit and the waist is so comfortable, not tight like some. And I love the soft material. Very pleased! Thank you!\n","961: The best sports bra I’ve had and a great deal. Had to size up but that’s fine! Buy these bras- they are amazing!!\n","962: Love this bag and fits everything I need for the gym. Thank you!\n","963: Too tight. I am 5'1, 114lbs 29in waist.Too tight. Too tight, too tight.Very odd fit. Have to wear the waist way up high for the length to be correct.Material is strange, not lined.I try them on and put them back and try them again. I dont think i can wear these\n","964: I bought it large. It is comfortable. The fabric is so soft.\n","965: Good quality metal and looks really cool when wearing them in both my nostril piercings\n","966: Super cute shirt and nice quality, I did buy a 3XL (I'm a size 16) and it fits perfectly. The fit is a little loose, exactly the way I like it. If you like a tighter fit, you might be fine with 2XL.\n","967: They have more universal sizes and the XL should cover up to 40C. The cups don't have the capacity to hold that kind of size, but the bra itself is really nice and if you are a smaller cup size, it will look super cute.\n","968: I'm so disappointed in the bra, it is way too small. I'm usually between a 36 and 38, but went ahead and ordered the larger size, since items from china tent to run a bit snug. The cups are not made to hold a C cup and the straps are not adjustable, since I do have a longer torso, the straps are digging in and the bra is not where it is supposed to be. I had to return it.\n","969: The bra itself was gorgous, the band was wide and comfortable, but even though I ordered a C cup (I'm a B), the cups were way to small and didn't look flattering at all.\n","970: Did not work for me, even though it says A/B and I'm a B, this is more for a very small A size. Bummer, the look was really nice.\n","971: I work this dress to work yesterday and felt like I could wear it into the evening. It is so comfortable and hangs nicely. I received so many compliments. The weight of the material is just right.\n","972: Fun way to wear owls.\n","973: Wash before you wear it. It did stain my pillow case. I had to tighten it a bit. It was a bit large. Good buy for the price. Material is inexpensive. I don’t think it will last the year. Fit my braids, stayed on through the night. Comfortable.\n","974: Fit well. I’m 5’3” 180lbs I purchased a large. I had to return it because the sequence was catching onto everything. I was afraid of damaging dress so I chose to return it.\n","975: Loved the dress from day one. I’m 5’3” 185 it fit perfectly! I hadn’t been out in soo long and I danced the night away in full comfort. The dress is beautiful! And for the price you can’t beat it!\n","976: Purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend. She didn't kill me for them, so I guess they worked.\n","977: Purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend. She didn't kill me for them, so I guess they worked.\n","978: I bought these as a gift for a friend. They love them, saying that they fit fine and are quite comfortable. That's about all I can say\n","979: Very nice comforting fit.\n","980: Fits just as I expected it to fit, one more thing I love about Alfred Dunner clothing.\n","981: At 4.99 for the pair and $4.99 for shipping and handling, the hats average out to under five bucks each.I bought several inexpensive beanie hats from different vendors through Amazon and the four that I've received so far from the Florida Hat Company and Hair Coverings are all very good. They have a nice tight weave, so they are not slouchy beanies; they're beanies that look presentable. They are all nice, bright colors. Without any stretching, they each have a circumference of approximately 14 inches, which you can of course stretch to fit a normal size head.I'm a small female who lives in New York and similar type hats have been my hat of choice for years. Each of the hats that I describe below have a good weave that is adequate enough to keep me warm in temperatures below fifty degrees; I don't find them suffocating hot in moderate temperatures and they keep me comfortable in thirty degree weather. I'm not foolish enough to stay out too long in temperatures lower than that; my lower earlobes may get a bit cold, but it's not bad.From Hair Coverings, I bought two hats that were labeled royal blue, but in truth one is closer to teal in color and is more inexpensive. The royal blue is the best of the four hats in terms of the quality of the acrylic yarn and the weave. It has no pills. The length is 12 ¾ inches. The teal hat is also good, but the quality of the yarn isn't as flawless as the royal blue; it's a little pilly, since the thread looks a bit uneven. It's still a good hat, however. Its length is 11 ½ inches.From the Florida Hat Co., I received the described hunter's orange hats that come as a pair. These have a slightly looser weave, but it's so minor that it's barely noticeable. The yarn is good, no pills. Its length is 11 ½ inches.If anyone reading this is from the Highridge area of Yonkers and is familiar with the 99 cent store near Pathmark that sold similar beanies, you'll have a better reference as to the quality of these hats. Each of the hats I bought on-line are within the four to five dollar range; I purposely chose those low prices because I was looking for a hat that's similar to the hats I used to purchase in Yonkers, which had a nice weave, weren't too hot, and have held up well in the wash for years. Well, the on-line hats meet all those qualities and are a bit larger with a slightly tighter weave. For me, they're excellent, and I'm glad that I was able to find pretty, bright colors that offer some degree of visibility when I'm crossing the street.\n","982: I'm going to return them. I ordered the size I wear in everything and even on my right foot (the slightly bigger one), I was swimming in them.\n","983: I wanted a pair of earrings that would look nice for day or evening and that I could sleep in as well. These are exactly what I was looking for. I like them a lot. They are very pretty, very sparkly, and still comfy if I lay down in them.\n","984: I wanted to love this. But it was way to small. But two sizes up.\n","985: I love this shirt. My student's thought it was funny and I was able to use it as part of my lesson that day. Sadly, I did have to explain it to a couple of grown-ups when I wore it to a party. It is SLIGHTLY smaller than true size so buy one size up to be safe.\n","986: It fit as expected, and it held up well in the wash.\n","987: Love the sparkles, color and flower design. Lots of compliments so I shared with many others at work.\n","988: It is very thin and small than I expected. Other than that it is a fine piece.\n","989: Silver jewelry goes attractively with any style or color as a tasteful fashion accessory.\n","990: Very cute on and a wonderful price point. You can dress this down or to go out at night. Very pretty and good quality.\n","991: Fits true to size and I wear it with leather pants and it looks great. Dress up or down.\n","992: Great product-easy-nice packaging\n","993: True to size, very well made. Cute and warm. Nice packaging- ready for gift giving. Color is true to website pics. Soft leather and cozy inside!\n","994: Took forever to arrive (but I knew that before purchasing) Worth the wait though. It is lovely. And it is very hard to find a zip up jacket like this with no collar. The embroidery is nice as well. And the color is pretty.\n","995: PROS:It functions as expected. The venting is great and at least on the black version, blends well.I have a 22\" head. It is ALMOST too tight. But works.The top of the hat is deep. So I can pull it down much further than in the photos. Fully over my eyebrows if I wanted.But it is tight enough that if I perch it higher it doesn't slip. (the bow in the back allows for further tightening).CONS:However the material feels more like nylon than polyester and thus makes a TON of noise every time you move your head and the back rubs against your shoulders. And the way it is shaped it cups your ears, funneling that \"fwip fwip\" noise right in at full volume.If you use the ponytail hole it increases the noisy because it weighs down the back.It also fights with the bow. You want the bow over the ponytail I think, but either way, the bow has to get distorted over or under the ponytail.\n","996: I love these. I have several styles including this one (Same brand, same material) and they all are wonderful. They are soft, they are not scratchy. They fit plus sizes very well. Size 20-26 for sure. But I suspect a8-28 is the full range. Smaller than that and it would be a little loose. It may fit bigger.They stay up well and don't run easily (I have not yet managed to make them run) Note that these are a thicker material. Not super thin like most tights.\n","997: It was an anonymous Christmas gift for a child. I thought it was good because it was a good weight and adjustable.\n","998: Very nice rocks. Smooth and several were nice and large in size. Daughter is happy with them. Paint pens work well to decorate them. Perfect craft for fighting the COVID19.\n","999: Comfy and pretty. I had a dble mastectomy with reconstruction and although the plus size fits me around, it does not cover my breasts fully. Might have to wait to wear until healing is complete. I am only a C so bummed that the bigger size didn't fit. Very pretty tho.\n"]}],"source":["for i in range(1000):\n","    print(f'{i}: {sample[\"cleaned\"].to_list()[i]}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0: I think this locket is really pretty.

High quality & very pretty.\n","1: Great\n","2: One of the stones fell out within the first 2 weeks of wearing it. Stones smaller than expected.\n","3: Crappy socks. Money wasted. Bought to wear with my tieks. Don’t stay on feet well.\n","4: I LOVE these glasses!  They fit perfectly over my regular, rectangular glasses that I always have to wear in order to see.  I really appreciate having these pretty and stylish and sturdy sunglasses to wear over my glasses.  I'll buy these again and again whenever I need a new pair, which hopefully won't be too soon.\n","5: Works OK for adults and is not at all kid friendly as stated. Slides down my 5 year olds face.\n","6: Great fit\n","7: Would be five stars but they are just too heavy for the size. So cute, gets lots of compliments, but pull the ears down.\n","8: What a cute top! Cam wait to wear in warm weather! Got nice\n","9: Very inexpensive, but too rough and uncomfortable for me, I have to return them..\n","10: Runs way smaller than indicated.\n","11: My son is a big Ninjago fan and these are perfect! The color is vibrant and hasn't faded in the wash. It also is made well and the pocket inserts and filters made it perfect! It looked a bit bigger than expected but once the filter was it, it was perfect to show off the entire design and was a good size for my 6 year old who is closer to the size of an 8/9 year old.\n","12: There are lots of raw edges.  Not well made.  Not at all flattering.  It was more wide than expected and not as long.  I thought this would be cute.\n","13: I really liked this shirt when I received it.  It is a really nice top.  I ordered the brown one.  The color of the shirt really looks nice with the floral sleeves. The surprise is that the sleeves are not T-shirt material.  They are of a good quality chiffon.  The knit fabric is good quality, also.<br /><br />I am 5’4” and weigh about 172 lbs.  I am a 36 DDD.  I ordered an XXL.  It is slightly on the big size.  It looks good, I would just prefer it a bit more form fitting.  The shirt covers my hips (length wise).\n","14: I really like this Tshirt.  Quality fabric.  Soft.  The puffed sleeves add interest.  I ordered the coral.  It is a nice color.<br /><br />I am 5’4” and weigh about 171 lbs.  I ordered an XL and it fits.  It is a bit loose, if you prefer form fitting.\n","15: I received this T the other day.  I took it out of the package and was instantly happy.  The fabric is really soft.  It is also a cute T.  I had to wear it right away.<br /><br />I am 5’4” and weigh about 174 lbs.  I am a 36 DDD.  I ordered an XXL.  Perfect fit.  Pay attention to the size chart.\n","16: Cutest charms for my Easter bracelets.\n","17: Daughter in law loved this. She said it's soft. She's happy.....I'm happy.\n","18: I went through the two original bands that came with the Samsung watch.  I had issues with the little screws and one just broke at the insert tab.  I bought this one as a replacement and after a few months, I'm still loving it.  I haven't had issues and have been able to keep my watch semi-tight on my wrist.  I use the heart rate feature so it can't be super lose.  I'd recommend this band and you can't argue with the price.\n","19: These earrings are more attractive in reality than in the photo.  I am very pleased.  They sparkle and shine.\n","20: Haven't been able to use it yet; it is a cold-weather item.  This is a simple fleece scarf  bought because it is styled with pockets at the ends.  It should function as designed.\n","21: Hat arrived without piece that secured and adjusts strap!  I needed it the next day so I had to sew it together!!\n","22: It is very pretty. But it is easy to break if not really careful.\n","23: Editing my review. I put on the second pair of capri leggings this morning and new in the pack, the crotch had a hole in it where the seem wasn't sewn together right\n","24: It's difficult to say how effective these are, but my grandchildren are wearing them while on their Ipads before bed, and hopefully they will eliminate the blue light that seems to have made it difficult for them to get to sleep.\n","25: Was surprised how wrinkled it is considering how much polyester it contains. I would say that's the only negative part.\n","26: The lenses pop out occasionally, not a fashion statement but does cover all eye area from spit spray. Only bought them for coronavirus protection. Cheaply made\n","27: My son loves this shirt!\n","28: Just fabulous and I love it so much!!!\n","29: Run VERY small , cheap material and not slit up the leg like pix shows... returned\n","30: Absolutely Adorable and perfect for church! Thank you so much\n","31: Had to order 2 sizes up from what I normally wear in Mavi jeans\n","32: I am 5'4&#34;/140 lbs. and ordered the small.  It is so long that it can't even be worn with heels!  I will get it hemmed at an additional cost.  Also, the material is somewhat strange like a tablecloth or curtain, not normal clothing material.  On the plus side, the colors and pattern is quite nice.  I ordered the navy blue with flowers.\n","33: Nice looking top made of a soft fleecy material.\n","34: Nice quality, but was worn n dirty when received.\n","35: GREAT STYLE - MUCH SMALLER THAN CHART\n","36: Love it!\n","37: These are adorable!! My 5 year old said they are comfy and she loves them.\n","38: MY daughter loves this dress. For the price it is pretty but it seems a bit cheap to me and was quiet big on my almost 5 year old and I ordered the 4.\n","39: Dress was to small.\n","40: Nice.pin but small and took forever\n","41: The printed design on this shirt is crooked & off center.  Looks & wears terrible.<br /><br />UPDATE; It's a simple design, but I guess it can easily be printed off center.  The replaced the bad t-shirt with a much better & well centered shirt.  It's nice to see a company do right by their customer, I would recommend them & purchase from them again.\n","42: Purchased the wallet in Amazon for $20!<br />I had the wallet for 2 weeks when I noticed the plastic locking latch & cracked & broken...<br /><br />Called Amazon & they couldn't repair or replace it, so they issued a refund.<br /><br />Then I emailed Sharkk (support@Sharkk.com) to see if they could repair or replace it... being that they are the manufacturer I was under the assumption that maybe they could do something more to stand behind their product!<br />Instead after about a week & a half customer service told me, &#34;...We cannot replace and refund your item. I hope you have a great day.&#34;  So, if I want a new wallet I have to pay $50... Why? Just so the cheap plastic piece can break again!<br /><br />I materials used to make this wallet could be better!  Beware if you buy this cheap plastic/aluminum box, & hopefully you don't have any issues!\n","43: I bought one for my husband for Christmas because my 7 year old daughter loves playing Pokemon Go with him....she was so excited when he openned it that I thought it would be adorable for them to have matching shirts and she was over the moon....the only issue is that this shirt is navy blue and not black like her dads but she didnt really care...it has held up in the wash too...no shrinkage...all in all, two well dressed Pokemon hunters in this house!\n","44: Great little evening bag for summer nights, pool parties, shore vacations.Eye catching and smart looking! Another nice bag from Mary Francis!\n","45: I love this hat! Everytime I wear it people stop me and tell me how beautiful my hat is, I'm thrilled because it's very flattering, it's warm and it's NOT real animal fur. I'd love to have it in other colors!\n","46: This is so comfortable and soft!  I think I’ll order a second jacket.\n","47: I haven't figured out how to get it programmed but it's a stunning watch piece.  Definitely an eye catcher.  Received lots of compliments.  If anyone can send me directions on how to program, that would be much appreciated.  Absolutely love this gorgeous watch!\n","48: Love my glasses.\n","49: I am a petite woman and this product fit over my classes without being overly large on my face. Love the purple print. The print is subtle and adds a nice accent without being garrish.\n","50: Pretty colors and great deal for the price!\n","51: You are going to love this dress! I bought the 5x (I'm a 40DDD) on top and it fits perfectly. I wash it and line dry, no ironing needed!\n","52: My mom loved it! This is her favorite Christmas move so what better present to get her!\n","53: It is absolutely adorable! Can’t wait for my grandchild to wear it!\n","54: Not the a split worst but definitely read the fine print. The photo shows 2 necklaces worn one ties in a knot. But you will only Get 1 necklace. I should have read the measurement better. - tricky tricky sellers\n","55: Loved this. Lightweight. I'm 5'11&#34; and fit my torso really well!\n","56: Love so cute on are little man\n","57: Good quality fit good\n","58: I wish the turtle big for a men i will look fo good size like 4 or5 inches turtle. My son love turtle.\n","59: This is really a cute design idea that was much appreciated by a 16-year-old family member who chose it for a gift.  I can see how it would be cute with a little bit of puff underneath it to display the skirt, but it was also cute just as is.  My reason for giving it only 4 stars was that the fabric was really thin and the placement of the notes on the fabric at the top of the dress was obviously not placed where the notes would have been the most attractive.\n","60: Ood fit and weird material. Wish I could return but window to return passed.\n","61: Really gorgeous but the way the photo is added onto the metal makes me feel as tho it will scratch off soon and the photo came as a weird color like it was tinted differently than the original photo. Lovely quality for the engraving tho and quick shipping\n","62: My daughter loves her “princess slippers “. They fit nice, a little difficult for her to fasten by herself, but they look great.\n","63: I have had ranger boots in the past and loved them. These boots are SO comfortable!! I wear them working landscaping every day and really put them through the test. They are super durable and super comfortable!\n","64: The dress fit well. I’m 5’10” and size 16, the length comes right down to the top of my knees. I got this in the army green and amaranth red color. I’m returning the green though because the color is not quite like the picture, it isn’t as dark. Instead of it being a deep army green shade, mine was more of a lighter mossy color that really isn’t too pleasant, think of green with a touch of poo brown thrown in.<br /><br />The amaranth red shade was much better, though still a bit off from the photo, had like a tint of mauve’y purple to it but I like it.\n","65: I'm 5'10&#34; and a size 16/18. I got this in a size XL and it was just too small through the shoulders, really tight in the arms and too short to be used as a dress. That wasn't surprising though to me, I'm used to dresses running short, if it fit in other ways, I could have used it as a tunic. The fabric was just ok. A bit on the thin side and it almost fit more like a mock neck. The neckline wasn't as scooped as the picture shows on me. If you are short-average height, you could probably make it work as a dress, but on me it just barely covered my backside. Color matched the picture.\n","66: I am 5'7&#34; and about 150 lbs, chest is 38&#34; C . I bought the large and it fits very well, it's low cut between the bosoms, so if you are modest it might be uncomfortable. It's a beautiful floral pattern and the body of the suit is not tight around my middle, comfortable wiggle room. Straps are adjustable.\n","67: Perfect. It was just what I was looking for. Fit nice and is exactly what I thought it was.\n","68: This t shirt is fair, I do like it, but the sleeves could be a little longer. I am giving it 4 stars as it's not great but for the price it's reasonable shirt. It arrived quickly and I have no issues with the seller.\n","69: Material is thin and it's not a high quality top. But it is nice for casual wear and it does fit as I thought it would. Comfy top.\n","70: For the price this is a nice shirt. Very thin material, but it arrived sooner than expected no issue with the service. It is a comfortable top and fits as I thought it would.\n","71: It's really cute it is a little snug and no room for error so if you are not sure order a size larger\n","72: its good and matches my purse; its also genuine leather\n","73: I love the way this is made not flimsy at all it stands up straight then with nothing in it<br />There is a slight shimmery glitter on on the jack picture<br />I carry two large wallets and makeup bag with medicine bottles and girls items and a check book and there is still room and it snaps easily the magnet on the closure is nice and strong I love the accent sides that has Sally's clothes patch work<br />This is a great purse it feels like it will last a while I just got it today I love it\n","74: Bought for a Xmas gift she loves it\n","75: the shirt was actually a size large at most and not a true XXL. nice material though\n","76: More comfortable everyday\n","77: Use a lot for sleep and relaxing\n","78: I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design. I do quite a bit of typing during the day so a thicker/wider band works better for me and this ring has that along with a beautiful design.  I wear it everyday and couldn't be more please with my purchase.  This is an excellent deal for your money!\n","79: Love the yellow and turquoise accents.  Nice bead, but small.\n","80: I'm 5'7&#34; and about 145lbs and a size large fit me very well. I had to get a backless/strapless bra and a pair of spanx to wear it but for the price that's worth it. The material is a bit heavy but not so much that you feel like it is weighing you down. I probably couldn't wear heels with it because then the front would look too short but flats should look good.\n","81: Is beyond cute! I love this necklace!\n","82: Very beautiful jewelry. I love the earrings and necklaces I have bought from this seller. Lots of detail and craftsmanship are apparent.<br />However, Amazon does not carry the matching set of earrings and necklace that the seller provides on their website.<br />The customer service the seller provides is amazing. I definitely recommend.\n","83: The shirt is made well, but the fabric is that weird polyester that a lot of clothing from China is made of.  Cute pattern. This was for my 9yr old son\n","84: Very nice and comfortable.\n","85: Had to return and get another size. Seller was prompt. This dress fits nice. Covers well and it’s airy enough so you feel comfortable. It’s not to thin or see threw. Ha ha really nice.\n","86: Gorgeous ring! It looked dainty and classic, but the ring size was too large. I had to return.\n","87: Wish it were a bit bigger, but Grandson loves it anyway.\n","88: Love the print\n","89: Really good quality, made an amazing gift!\n","90: Very flimsy and lightweight.<br />Scratch easily. I fully expect these to fall apart quickly.\n","91: Great price and fits wider, more muscular calfs. However the ankle is a bit baggy and bunches up.\n","92: Bought as a gift for my teen daughter.  They were longer than I expected, but they are just the way she likes to wear them!\n","93: Larger than appeared\n","94: Very cute belt and this  specific animal print was a perfect match for a pair of heeled sandals. It's versatile and cute with jeans or even With a dress. The construction appears to be decent, with regular wear it doesn't appear as if it would fall apart. I would highly recommend and would definitely buy again.\n","95: Gave as a gift to my son\n","96: It worked for the project I bought it for. It performed much better than screw devices.\n","97: Fits great\n","98: The buckle does not stay buckled. Cute, but constanly picking it up off the floor because it doesnt stay on.\n","99: I am surprised it fits me exactly and for my body shape but it is a little tight on top but well I like it it looks exactly as described and I like it a lot I may just buy a second one in another colour as well.\n","100: These are probably the best pair of pjs I've bought in a long while and they are so comfortable and soft I love them ! I haven't washed them yet so I don't know for sure if they will shrink or not but I don't think they will and even if they did they fit pretty well so I doubt it'd be any issue I just really like the material in general my fav pair of pjs in a long time I really care about comfort when I sleep :)\n","101: I noticed because I have big arms and wide chest that this is extremely small at the top, the dress in general fit very well but it literally was very tight on the arms and at the top in general and I ordered the XL I'm not even that big on that matter so I'd say if you are on the bigger sized chest or similar this dress will not fit. It did not fit me at the arms and that only happens when it's made too small there for me anyway because I don't even have a lot of boobs so that leads me to believe it would definitely not fit someone with a bigger chest either.\n","102: Ultra comfortable pjs!!! Stretch and soft I cannot love these more. True to size.\n","103: I am so excited and happy to have found this dress/jumper short thingy. I really really love it! It fit me like a glove and I have curves and I am a size XL and getting big but this actually fit me fantastically I am thrilled and I can't wait to use it &#60;3 It arrived faster than expected and in great conditions :D I might edit my review with a picture later :)\n","104: Love these shorts! They are so comfortable and fit SO well! I like them quite a lot! They do come in a little smaller than I expected I normally wear an XL and I had to rebuy these at an XXL because the XL DID fit but it was tight and I'm not even that big. I mean I am but not thattt much. So maybe go one size up just in case. I use these for exercising at home and they work great and are very comfy and stretchy so I like them.\n","105: These are great they fit perfectly and they go up the waist also so they're great for holding the tummy and to be in shape I suppose if I used them more often and worked out in them they'd be a great help also to trim the fat :)\n","106: Love it really pretty for the price totally worth it :)\n","107: Just what I needed :) Looks exactly like the picture and I'm a bit on the heavy side so really good fit too :)\n","108: Perfect and so pretty as decoration! &#60;3 I loveeee it so much !\n","109: This is one of the few Asian products that are really true to size that I've bought before. I decided to go for an XL because I am chubby and in the end it was way too big for me should have gone for an L and I have big shoulders and wear bra size 38 as well as big hips too and it still fit well enough. I have a pear shaped body though but it is very true to size and fits perfectly, if you are not sure whether to get an XL or L I hope this gives people a better idea and it really does look like the picture and actually good product 5/5 would buy again.\n","110: This product came in a different colour than the one described in the picture, it was more pink rather than the red one I ordered. Almost a flashy pink colour and the material was really poor quality I honestly didn't expect it to be such bad quality, basically he colour I don't care at all but the quality was just baddd, not very stretchy at all and not even cotton very very thin fabric and just cheap, it looks very cheap in general :( I'm dissapointed because I ordered this product mostly because I thought it was better quality as well as for the color and it's just bad. Save your money, I do not recommend this product.\n","111: I ordered these for an at home beer tasting with friends. I also ordered some beer tasting place mats to go with it. This set comes with 12 cups and the place mats have 4 spots. So this set was not enough for my party of 4 to use. So I ended up using some inexpensive plastic cups that I already had on hand for one person. These cups are nice and sturdy, but they come stacked in sets of three. It was very difficult to pull them apart and one actually cracked while trying to separate it from the stack. Yes, you can wash these and reuse them, but I ended up just throwing them away. For the cost of these, I would rather just buy the cheap plastic cups that I had to supplement with instead of these. If those crack, it's kind of expected.\n","112: I ordered this set of socks for my teen daughter. She was absolutely thrilled by them. She is a huge Fall Out Boy fan and loves these! She loves wearing cute, no-show socks. This assortment has cute FOB logo designs. They are cute, trendy colors, too. The fit is perfect. She wears a size 9 shoe.\n","113: My daughter asked for new seamless underwear. I thought this was a nice assortment of neutral colors. She wears a juniors size medium to large or a misses small to medium. She's 5'7&#34; and weighs about 130 pounds. These fit her well and are very comfortable. They do seem a little longer than other boy short styled underwear that she has worn in the past. Because they are longer, they do hang below some of her shorts so she has to push the legs up at times. Overall, she does like them.\n","114: I can't read anything without wearing my Readers these days. I make sure that I keep a pair everywhere I might need one. I have ordered many different ones and so far, these are definitely some of the better ones. I often wear a pair on the top of my head so I have them handy. These fit well on my head without slipping down. I've had several different ones that keep slipping off my head when I bend over or tilt my head, these do not. The arms are sturdy and give just enough. The frames feel heavy duty and attractive looking. I am very happy with these! These are definitely better than the ones I pick up at the dollar store.\n","115: Plastic and all squished. No thanks.\n","116: No it was terrible.. poorly made I've seen better rings come out of bubblegum machines.\n","117: Loose and comfortable for hanging around the house\n","118: My husband loves how it fits.\n","119: I wear flip flops all the time during the summer outside, and much of the year inside my house (separate pairs to keep the floors cleaner), and am always looking for a good buy.  These are good for the price and, unlike one review I read, spot-on for size (I went with a larger size due to that review and was sorry I did).\n","120: Works great but you need to keep the \"stickers\" to be able to wear them again\n","121: Love them to death#\n","122: Love the colors. Fits great and very comfortable.\n","123: I like these vest  extenders using them I get so air moving through my leather vest. Can get hot in the summer wearing black leather\n","124: Perfect for keeping road dirt off your face.\n","125: soft and warm, thank you.\n","126: Stiff linen material. How can there be stretch stretch? Its linen!Not true to fit. Short in length and tiny waist for Xtra large size ordered. I have a 34inch waist. What else could go wrong?\n","127: Nice looking but too small unless you have tiny fingers and for a bonus turned my fingers black after wearing them. Obviously not pure copper\n","128: Good quality for the price. Comfy and looks great.\n","129: Great dress! Fits well , comfortable, and looks great.\n","130: Overall I like this bouffant. The fabric is thick and it is well made; it fits well. I purchased it when I was working in the COVID unit. I have long hair and throughout the day it would fall apart and feels heavy, pulling and irritating my scalp. I am sure all the girls with long hair know what I am talking about. This bouffant has enough space to fit all of my hair inside without a hair tie. Being able to avoid touching my hair in a 12-16hr shift is a big plus. However, I am rating it 3 stars... because the color faded dramatically after just 1 wash, 1 drying cycle. It's soooo faded now...<br /><br />I recommend this product, just avoid dark color, so the fading is not too obviouse.\n","131: Cheap quality, very small, and it took a month to ship, smells like dead fish.\n","132: Nice. Haven't worn but once. Weather here been in the 80's. Comfy.\n","133: So beautiful. Got lots of complements.\n","134: Socks are easy to put on and fit up to just below my know.  The only issue i have is that for me, it can get a bit sore at the top  of the sock.  likely with folks with a smaller leg than mine, will fit fine and feel fine.  I have to say that these do over all fit me better then any other sock i have bought.  the size i used is M/L\n","135: these were a big hit at Christmas .. and great for the cold.\n","136: Fell apart after a couple washes.\n","137: Cute! But, a smidge short so it’s awkward. It doesn’t quite cover my booty. My booty is big tho. I still wear it with cute leggings, but it would look better over those leggings a smidge longer.\n","138: Fit true to size. Came with a small hole on the seam, that’s why 4 stars. Otherwise cute!\n","139: I like it and get lots of<br />Compliments when I wear it.\n","140: Fits like a glove, I ordered it for Wizard World. I’m still shedding the baby weight so a perfect cosplay was Peter B Parker from Into the spider-verse. I ordered a medium and at first looked like a small but I tried it on a loved it.\n","141: Great belt! Perfect way to dress up an outfit.\n","142: Belt fits well and is a fun accessory to pair with an outfit.\n","143: This is a lovely nightgown, very soft, not heavy but heavy enough to be warm. Highly recommended.\n","144: Soft, comfortable, easy to wash, sized well, highly recommended!\n","145: I loved this tee so much but when it arrived the fit and the cut was really unflattering. Cut more like a man's tee than a woman's so I had to return. Shame as the design on the front was fun and was overall a good quality item. Just hated how it looked on.\n","146: Product was as expected and delivery was quick\n","147: Just as expected\n","148: Larger than I expected. Nice for a little thought. On the flimsy side\n","149: Bought this shirt for my brother and he loves it. Said it was the softest shirt he has.\n","150: To big doesn't sit right at all paw is never even visible\n","151: These are perfect. Very easy to put in and very smooth once they are in. I forget they’re even there\n","152: This pair fit very awkwardly. Someone was in a hurry to finish sewing. It feels as though the front and back pieces were reversed in the sewing process.\n","153: I bought these as a Christmas gift for a fellow Outlander fan. She loved them!\n","154: I haven't worn outside yet, so I don't know about the waterproof factor.<br />I usually wear a medium in men's gloves.  I ordered medium and they're snug. If I order again I'll go up a size. I will edit post to let you all know about them being waterproof.\n","155: Cute, but they turn a bit on the foot. I would buy again.\n","156: I love these tops....I've now ordered 3. They are sheer which makes it more comfortable to wear in layers. For the money spent, it is a great purchase. Will probably get a couple more colors.\n","157: Description is wrong so I'm returning them, no arch support\n","158: I love the fit.\n","159: I gave 5 stars for warmth assuming it stands for coolness. Overall, great mask. My husband loves it and uses it for work every day. The elastic keeps it in place and it’s loose enough that he doesn’t feel suffocated while working in a manufacturing plant.\n","160: My breast were hanging out of the side band because it is cut so narrow.\n","161: This tshirt dress is the most comfortable dress I own. It’s form fitting but super stretchy! The material is super soft.\n","162: I bought this shirt because my girlfriend loves dave grohl, and ive never seen this shirt anywhere else. because it came all the way from Thailand it took a little longer than the impatient person I am wanted it too. BUT its awesome. I love it, and happy with it. I even wrote to the person selling the shirt to say &#34;hey its sucks its gonna take so long&#34; and they were really nice and patient and explained to me that they are in Thailand, which I didn't know.  buy this!!\n","163: Fits perfect love the extra room.\n","164: Horrible, way too big for my daughter and plus when I went to return it, I had to pay an additional $25.00 to ship the return, ridiculous, waiting to hear from the buyer. Just a huge hassle not worth to me.\n","165: Really boxy fitting not at all flattering\n","166: Seems like this work's but I have to try another strength:(\n","167: I really like them,came on time and nice quality for the price would but again.\n","168: Very pretty on,made well and for the price I only wish that they had this in more colors\n","169: Omg! The socks are amazing solo! Comfortable I love the way they feel easy to put on! I'm definitely buying some more!😃\n","170: Can’t wait to make bracelets\n","171: Now!  This is a true Green Bay packers bracelet.  I was expecting something cheap.  It’s not!  This is a very sharp bracelet. Get It and you won’t regret it!\n","172: I really really like these. I ordered more. Too bad they didn’t have more colors\n","173: I like that they were light and the color is pretty\n","174: They weren't quality made\n","175: These are okay. Not very shinny\n","176: Very cheap. Like I got from a bubble gum machine\n","177: This is where all the cracker Jack's prizes are??\n","178: I order this.  looks good but it's not . the material reminded me of the cloth you would wear like a bandage for a broken arm or something  (Medium is small)\n","179: I know this isn't real.  But it really looks bad.  I feel like the pearl is going to  fall off. I always order jewelry.  But this wasn't what I expected. Reminds me of something you would get from a candy machine. Don't bother buying it save your money.\n","180: Sending back for a refund, the stone was to loose,And while I was at the grocery store I lost the stone. Other than that it's very beautiful and true to it's size.\n","181: My daughter loves it! Easy to get on and off. Easy to swim in. Perfect fit. Very modest. Would love to buy a couple more in different colors. I’ll keep checking to see if any come in.\n","182: Comfortable, stretchy, high waisted, and just what I was hoping for. Ended up buying another pair because I like them so much. I’m 5 ft 3 in and 110 lbs and medium was a good fit.\n","183: This is the smallest key chain I cannot even read what it says\n","184: Good Product\n","185: Good Product, super comfortable, light fleece so medium warmth, plenty of stretch, true to size\n","186: Good Product\n","187: Good Product\n","188: Good Product\n","189: Good Product\n","190: Good Product\n","191: Good Product but sizing off\n","192: Good product\n","193: Good product\n","194: The best features of this watch are:<br />1. A 10 yr battery that may outlive me<br />2. Easy to read numbers<br />3. VERY Good illumination of the dial<br />4. Easy to set up<br />5. Allows me to set one screen for DST and the other for EST. I will simply push the button to get to the other time.<br /><br />I am a happy camper!\n","195: Worked very well for my husband and 10 year old son.\n","196: Perfect fit\n","197: Very Comfortable Light Weight Cover All. No Shrinkage After Many Machine Wash & Dryer. Great As Open Light Weight Robe Also.\n","198: This Is An Excellent Support Bra. The Extra Criss Cross give additional support in comforting way & bra is overall prettier than shown in product photos. Lovely.\n","199: Great Shoe Design. Runs Short In Sizing, Sadly Had To Return Them. I Truly Love Them. Next Size Up Won't Work For Me.\n","200: Dress For Is Good. Fabric Is Soft With Good Weight. Drapes Nicely. Color Is Saturated Well.\n","201: I love this dress but the fit was to tight around bust and waist . Order 1 size larger if you are extra blessed in these areas. I Will order again after loosing a few more pounds if it is in stock.\n","202: As a CNA, my feet and legs always ache to the point where I can't walk after a shift. That completely changed after I started wearing these! I am able to actually keep up! I wear these on the airplane, when my legs ache or when I have a POTS flare. I get so many complements on these and would totally recommend!\n","203: My daughter has many medical conditions that makes her medical team nervous when others aren't aware when she is away at college. Having this attached to her Apple Watch (40mm) makes her, the medical team and her parents feel way more at ease. She likes it because it is discreet compared to other alert bracelets she has used in the past. It doesn't bother her at all yet provides the added sense of security we need. Would definitely recommend to a friend!\n","204: Nice bracelet for the price.\n","205: These shoes ran very small. Glad the price was so low. Turns out they made a good Christmas gift. I bought 13's should have bought 14's.\n","206: Just what I was looking for!  Fits perfectly.  Great doing business here.\n","207: Nice quality, looks just like the picture, fits my 5 year old daughter perfectly. No shrinkage in the wash.\n","208: These were exactly as advertised. Ive had these same earrings since 2001 and when I lost the ball off of one then the ring went down the drain i thought I would never find them again but i was wrong!! Love them\n","209: My girlfriend loved it because \"it sleeps comfortably\" and \"it fits\"!\n","210: Keeps time well. I needed a clock for work since we arnt allowed to have phones at work so i keep this on my work badge and helps tell time.\n","211: Piece of crap.  It looks nice in the photo but the minute you pull it out of the wrapping, you see how cheap in is.  That's okay because I just wanted a cheap travel watch.  The big problem is the watch loses time....about 5 minutes a day.  Whoever heard of a battery watch losing time?  Don't waste your time.\n","212: It's good and durable. Looks cute. The bottom button is rather high and the material is thin so definitely an item to wear around your significant other only. It's fairly forgiving. The back is perfect, even for those of us with booty. Looks just like the picture.\n","213: Very happy that I found a good fit.\n","214: There absolutely stunning! Especially for the petite eating wearer!<br />Thank you\n","215: Bought for my niece. Perfect, now we have matching shirts.\n","216: Gift for young man who live next-door graduated high school very attractive and quite reasonable\n","217: Good quality, soft material, love it.\n","218: Love it, quality product and material. As advertised\n","219: Very thin, see-thru fabric, even though a dark print (primary color black)...heavy leotards weren't sufficient... required a \"slip\".....which made the outfit hot (102 outside- Texas Heat Wave!!).<br />Love the print itself....but the quality is lousy, including the manufacturing of the waistband.\n","220: Very comfy, EZ fit but hand-wash only\n","221: Design is adorable but the fabrics for the bag itself were out of the industrial grade bin. The adorable cats are LOST on the rough &amp; cheap grade fabric. The Fade-to-Gray fabric cheapens it further, &amp; don't forget the dull Brown Straps.  What a disappointment! !!\n","222: Very lovely and fashionable enough to be &#34;viewed&#34; under the appropriate fashion garment\n","223: Well made and nice looking\n","224: Under a magnifying glass, these earrings are cute!  Photos in description were misleading .....\n","225: These where too big for me. I wear a 36C, and I’m a older women.<br />My daughter is bigger busted and these fit her.She said they are So comfortable.<br />She buys her bra’s at Victoria Secret, but now she also wears these bra’s more around the house.<br />although for going out sometimes also..<br />She likes these for sleeping..<br /><br />There made ok, but that price it is a good deal.\n","226: I was surprised when I recieved this!<br />Shirt runs big in some places, but not in others.<br />I bought the large, I wanted it to be big for the winter to lay around the house in for cold winter weather in California.<br /> The size is strange. I'm 5'2 136 lbs.. My daughter is 5'6 busty, and would have<br />Bought this in a extra large,  this kinda fit her, but sewed goofy, and material is awful feeling.<br /><br />The material is shiney, not a sweat shirt material at all, and not cozy.  Sleeves are bat wings, wierd. The neck is not exactly round, and too big.<br />The color pumpkin was not a solid color, its like a orange whiteish  stripe!<br />Sewing is not good.<br />Not comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I'm disapointed and waited over 6 weeks to get this.<br />I do not recomend this shirt.<br /><br />.\n","227: Up-date. Beware..This shows in my size and color , Free Returns. So I took a chance and bought it. Big mistake!<br />But when I tried to return this, now the seller wants me to pay for International shipping!!<br />This was a 2 star, now its a One star.<br />I called Amazon, and they took care of my refund.<br />Amazon is the Best, that is why I shop on Amazon.<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />The design is ok  but the gray is a strange color. I can't even describe it!<br />For me it ran big, Hugh. I ordered a large, as I can’t figure out if some of the clothes from china ,run bigger, or smaller !.<br />I’m 5’2 138 lbs, older women,  and this was too big, or tight in the wrong places!!!.<br />Around the neck was saggy, and so was the back part of the neck..<br />The back near my waist  was sewed uneven, but in the wrong places.<br /><br />I have found out these tops are a hit or miss. I guess it depends on who is sewing them..Are they 10 years old, or what?<br /><br />The top part has No seams, its made from one piece of material,including the  sleeves , very strange.<br /> The bottom part is a separate piece of material that is sewed  on.<br /><br />I’m returning this.<br />Btw, it took a month to finally receive this!!\n","228: Material is itchy and thin. I did not like this shirt\n","229: Good for anyone who walks unsteady or has slippery floors.\n","230: I even got a size bigger but it still was not long enough. It worked anyway but I was hoping it was going to be like the ad where she's wearing it down/over her hips. Mine ended more at the waist.\n","231: The shirt color is cute (I got navy blue) and I like the texture of material but the fit is very boxy and wide. You have to tuck part of the shirt in to make it look decent. If you leave the entire shirt untucked it looks like you're wearing a triangle...it just sort of hangs out and doesn't fot around the waist.\n","232: Wrong item came\n","233: It's nice and roomy. I have a lot of packed in it!\n","234: nicely made. fits my 4 year old perfectly.\n","235: It looks like moths already attacked it before it got here. 1 wash and it would be over.<br />I like the cotton feel but, this is a seriously cheap sweater. Definitely wouldn't give as a gift.l\n","236: It looks like moths already attacked it before it got here. 1 wash and it would be over.<br />I like the cotton feel but, this is a seriously cheap sweater. Definitely wouldn't give as a gift.l\n","237: This was a beautiful well made and roomy case!! It was far too big fir my 14.1' laptop tho.<br />Lovely and professional!!!\n","238: Good casual dress. Not too short. I'm 5'2&#34; 110lb, I normally wear a small(size 2 dress) and ordered a medium, I should have ordered a small, it would not have been tight AT ALL. I'll take in the waist.<br /><br />It did not shrink in the wash, but I will leave you with this, it's not a dress for Summer time in Florida. No fabric type or wash instruction tags but it almost feels like a cotton mixed with microfiber or something. Very staticky and very warm. I'll have to use it for Fall and Spring. I paired mine with Chuck Taylor Shoreline shoes :) cutesies\n","239: Just love these! My daughter is 3 months old and the bands are almost too big but it's good because they're not too tight.\n","240: I ordered size larger, as I feel too uncomfortable wearing tight clothes. Unfortunately, this was a lot smaller than expected. Would suggest getting two sizes larger.\n","241: Keeps her pants up!\n","242: it is soft and warm and fits perfectly. washes well too. a great buy for the money. great seller!\n","243: it arrived early and packaged well  this is soft, fits wonderfully.\n","244: This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!\n","245: not cotton, more likely a Rayon Spandex mix that will be HOT and therefore it's not something for beachwear in the south.\n","246: I loved the watch but the band is getting frayed and it can't be replaced according to my watch guy.  Its to unusual a size.\n","247: I purchased a few of these as x-mas gifts for my hipsy friends. Its a cute, fun item but upon receipt, it really does not look as well made as in the picture. Still a fun items and worth the price! My friends all loved them!\n","248: This SKINO ALPHABET KEY RING (Letter E KK 83) looks exactly like the product page photo, and that’s a major problem!  Instead of getting the key fob with a base metal “E” on a black enamel ground that I was expecting, I got a key fob with a plastic-covered PHOTOGRAPH of a drawing of a metal “E” on a black ground.  The drawing of the “E” is complete with the phony air-brushed sparkle in the upper left corner.  The ugly “Skino” logo is also prominent.<br /><br />This is the ugliest key ring that I have ever seen.  (My photo makes it look far better than it really is, thanks to the sandstone background.) There is no way that I’m going to carry around a fake-looking thing like this, and it’s going directly into the trash. This is vastly overpriced (about $10 on Amazon).  I would send it back, but the return shipping would cost more than it sells for.\n","249: Soft fabric. Great color. Cute style. Stretchy. Cannot lift your arms as the dress rides up. Way up. If you pull the dress down, it sits at the perfect length, however if you move, the dress rises significantly. I have to return. I am 5ft 6, short-legged and weigh 115lbs.size small.  Fits as pictured, but about 4 inches shorter than the photo when you move. Might be cute with cropped leggings.\n","250: Great length!  I was worried that it would be too short for me, but remarkably surprised that it’s a nice modest length falling to my calves. The white stripes are such that I would require a white slip or leggings for modesty. Neckline is nice. I wish the sleeves were 3/4, but I have a bolero and a star ⭐️ lace jacket I can wear over it for better mosquito 🦟 protection. Have a happy 4th of July, in Freedom.\n","251: I like the idea. But, I wasn’t that pleased with customer service. I measured correctly and ordered accordingly. Placed a call twice and no one answers, just voicemail. I’d probably order again if they had a longer options.\n","252: Sadly, one arrived with a flaw. The lace is pretty, but I won’t be able to wear them to my function on Friday.\n","253: I bought this dress 3 days before prom and it came on time and exactly when it needed to be. Luckily the dress fit perfectly and was elegant and gorgeous and everything I was hoping for on prom. It's modest and has a classic beauty to it. There is lace really only on the front of it and the back is mostly just the solid color with a elegant low back (but not low enough for the bra to show). The cap sleeves are perfect and sit on a place where you don't need to worry about your bra strap showing. The only thing that I would suggest if you purchase this dress is to definitely size and compare your sizes to the charts it provides so that you can get an accurate fitting. Also, it is very form fitting, especially in the bottom area so underwear lines WILL show, so I would recommend purchasing either a thong or very thin underwear. What I did was purchase a stomach shaper that was high wasted and the leg holes went farther down to where it wasn't tight on the dress so the lines didn't show, that way you can also have a little added support and control to any tummy rolls and flatten it all down for a perfect fit. Amazing dress at a great price! Go for it!!\n","254: Comfortable without messy up your hair.<br />Misleading ad!!!  Says 3 pack in header but only only came.\n","255: Cute as can be. I had to cut 4 inches off the length because I wanted a tunic like dress to wear with leggins. I am 5' short. It is well worth the price.\n","256: Nice item at right price. Light jacket for coolish times.\n","257: I love these they are so fun to wear..\n","258: Very pretty but I don't thing it would be very strong for a heavy piece..\n","259: OK it took forever to get here I guess the seller was telling the truth about mailing it. But it really sucks it took so long I been gave up.\n","260: I am so happy with all the mid length little dresses I have purchased this season, this purple one is sassy with the ruffle hem, and cap sleeve. It even has pockets ....\n","261: what a great surprise!  these are the cutest most fun ear-bobs, I just love these\n","262: These do not wear well at all.  Frequent washings have left them nearly threadbare.\n","263: Thought I was getting a ‘normal’ t shirt & mehhhh. The cut is unflattering to me, it’s not as short as a crop top but for a mother of 4 😅 It’s wide & short.\n","264: The dress  fit nice and was comfortable.\n","265: Worst mask ever not breathable. Don't get these.\n","266: Don't get this if you are used to having big pockets in your coats but it is warm and cozy.I ordered a blue one but got red\n","267: This is a fantastic selection of high quality chips.  The bottles are larger than most that I have purchased, so it's a great value.\n","268: These little guys are heavy duty, yet also fine in detail.\n","269: Good value for money, looks like photo, beautiful green color.\n","270: I usually wear a small (5’ 6” - 127 pounds) but the small was really big. The crotch hung low and left a lot of space. The top fit well and the length was ok but the middle was too big.\n","271: I was a little skeptical when I purchased this item. I usually don't buy clothes unless I can try them on first. I'm short and lil chunky.<br />But when I received it, it fit and I liked it so much I ordered in another color! Very soft & comfy!\n","272: I bought these as back-up sun-Gs in a pinch when I misplaced my other pair and knew I had a trip coming up.  They arrived as promised and look as presented in the pic.  Very flattering.  The square frames with the slightest cat-eye tilt bring nice angles to round and heart-shaped faces like mine.  Great pair to have around.\n","273: Very soft material.  Very flowy.  It does fit larger than expected.  I read this in the reviews but even knowing this it was larger than expected.  I am 5'4&#34;, 150 lb, hourglass, muscular, usually buy size 8/10 dresses and jeans and size M/L stretchy bottoms.  I got a medium in this skirt and it sits very loosely around my hips.  I bought it to wear over leggings in the wintertime so I am not really concerned by its looseness, but if I wanted to wear this without bottoms, I would definitely have returned this to get a small. It is a little longer than I wanted as well-- I wanted something mid-thigh or a little longer -- but I get the look that I was aiming for by pulling it up to my waist.\n","274: I was very pleased with the fit of this item however the cross straps on the right sleeve did not say where they belong. The upper cross was way too long any item is being returned\n","275: So soft and comfortable. Always get compliments when wearing!\n","276: Picture is as shown. Material is soft and comfortable. Color is as shown.\n","277: Runs short\n","278: Be very careful to pay attention to details! I thought I was ordering a size 22/24. The 24 was actually a waist size. It was my mistake!!!!! They’re beautiful and I wish I could order in my size. The only reason I gave them 4 stars was to put us larger ladies in notice that the size is in inches.\n","279: Very comfortable fits well<br />Can't go wrong with this brand\n","280: Very comfortable easy to wash and the length is perfect\n","281: Very comfortable easy to wash and being tall fits perfectly the length\n","282: Very good product never been disappointed fits very well\n","283: With the stores just reopening it's hard to find Capri's pajamas.<br />They fit good very comfortable\n","284: Nice looking shirt, but wrinkles very easily.\n","285: Got for my teenage son.. got 2 pack for under $7.. and they’re worth it.. not too mention, they look pretty cool in pe class in high school- Does it get better then that? I don’t think so!! Made/wash well so far.. and used about 2 months.. definitely would buy again! Can’t go wrong for the price I got...\n","286: Bought this dress for my babyshower and it fit as expected. I'm 4'11 so the only thing I did was cut it shorter, but that was just my preference. It was comfortable and stretches too. Color is the same as the picture and I loved it.\n","287: Love the color . Lots of compartments. Zippers are of good quality. Hearty leather is softening w/use ( should withstand loads of use)  makes the over all bag very heavy before adding contents. Straps are a bit to thick for a female shoulder ((have not used it as back pack yet) but the handle on the overall bags works well. Hardware adds style. Received many compliments.\n","288: Very pleased with my purchase.\n","289: Very happy with this shirt. I usually dont buy clothes online because they never fit. This looks exactly as it does in the picture and fits perfectly. I wish I had ordered two.\n","290: I am an older woman,  and I am impressed with this piece, both playful and apt for an evening out against a black dress.  Long enough to double up and still falls nicely around the neck.  I love the Chuvora pieces, so affordable for a unique piece of jewelry.  Beautifully designed and executed.<br /><br />ooh, BTW, the amount of compliments that I have got on this piece and now many piece of Chovura is amazing.\n","291: Perfect\n","292: Nice enough hat.\n","293: Fit right, quality fabric and good boy’s style!\n","294: Very comfortable came very quickly, but I’m going to order another pair in the future. I plan on ordering 1/2  One Size smaller because they stretch out.\n","295: Nowhere in the description does it say this is a model kit with tons of pieces that you have to put together.  Very light plastic and even if I were in the mood to glue a car kit together, it still isn’t worth the money.\n","296: The propellers don’t stand erect.  They fall to the side like a limp noodle.  Very disappointing since I got them for a birthday party.  Had to return them.  The wire is too long and too bendy and the propeller and beads were clearly added as an afterthought.  Don’t waste your money.\n","297: This watch does not keep time, it's really lightweight and flimsy, and broke after 4 days of barely using it.  This was a waste of money.  And the ring.  Don't get me started on the ring.  The metal coating on it was flaking off of it immediately, and it has jagged edges.  Ouch.\n","298: I love the feel of this turtleneck and it fits my daughter perfectly.  I can tell it's going to last a while, which is great.  Even after washing there is no pilling.  Never need to iron it.  I'm happy with this purchase and the price.\n","299: This T-shirt has a great saying which my adult daughter will love!  The quality is excellent!\n","300: My grandson loves pandas! I had to get this for him.  I washed it prior to giving it to him because it smelled like vinegar.  I washed in cold water.  I put it in the dryer on delicate and I pulled it out before it was completely dry.  Since it is angift I was hoping that it would look like new.  It was pretty wrinkled.  Anyhow... he still liked it because it's a panda.\n","301: My grandsons love their new pjs with sharks!!!  Great fit and bright colors!\n","302: Love the style, but so thin you need to wear a slip under it.\n","303: These are the most comfortable pj's  I have found!<br />I especially like that the top is longer....which is flattering.\n","304: Decided I really did not want all of these, but waited too late to return them. Guess I can use them for gifts.\n","305: I like light sweaters in the summer.  This is perfect, nice drape, will work well with some of my sleeveless summer a line dresses.<br />Slimming, with a just a bit of a flair at the hips which I like.  I’m a size 8, ordered medium, fits well.\n","306: Product is exactly as advertised. Great value.\n","307: Good quality & beautiful design\n","308: I use this when running outside in the cold & it works well to keep my ears warm. Haven’t washed it yet so I don’t know how it will hold up.\n","309: This is actually my second shirt because I got bleach on my first one.  I really love the fit and it covers well in length if you’re overweight and don't like your belly exposed.  I wish this came in a multitude of colors and patterns because I would certainly buy more!\n","310: Pretty cool!\n","311: Earrings were exactly what I wanted.\n","312: Love them, Comfy and great price!\n","313: I researched these wraps for a long time trying to make sure I found a soft cotton one that was comfy. Unfortunately, I chose this one. It's so big and the Velcro 8s not long enough so I can't wear. The straps are too short to wear comfortably as well. Also, I do not like the feel of microfiber because it feels weird on my skin. It is not a great product in my opinion.\n","314: When you are pretty in pink you need a pink passport cover.  This one provides rfid and is cute too.\n","315: I actually enjoy these pearls!  The silver chain is delicate and lovely.\n","316: These sweatpants are made of a light material, yet warm enough in colder weather indoors. Have stood up well to laundering and are economical, too.\n","317: I am 5' 8'' with a large chest (42 E). The top &#34;fit&#34;, but it wasn't flattering.The back rode up and then the front sunk down. No support whatsoever.<br /><br />I followed my measurements to a T on their size chart. Like I said, it fit, But wasn't a great match if that makes sense.<br /><br />The bottoms fit and covered the cheeks, but the waistband was very tight. It pushed all my skin around my stomach out. So it was a nice tummy suck in, but everything above the waistband got all squished.<br /><br />So I guess maybe if you had less post baby chest and hips, it'd be a better fit haha<br /><br />Loved loved the colors! So bright.<br /><br />I was really hoping this could be a good fit, but it wasn't. Maybe it could be for you. Just keep in mind that the waistband was VERY tight.\n","318: Bought these as a gift for grandma because we were sick of her wearing her blue blockers that looked too big in her face. These fit her glasses perfectly and now she just has to remember to flip them up and down.\n","319: love the shirt, it looks just like the picture, but the tears are a little scratchy on the skin, I recommend an under shirt when you wear it.\n","320: Synthetic sweaty material. Ill fitting. I can’t say whether this was too large or too small. Technically it fit my waist but the crotch hangs at least 10 inches lower than it should & the top is too baggy but the legs fit as they should. I generally do not have a problem finding clothes that fit online. I was offered a 50% refund if I would keep it but it’s not even worth that. I’m going to pay shipping in order to get the full refund because I can’t even regift this in good conscience.\n","321: Not the best. Too small and broke too easily.\n","322: The only thing he didn't like was no way to adjust the straps\n","323: Bought this for my Granddaughter to replace one her &#34;Papa&#34; had given her that she had lost.  She said she loves it and wears it everyday.\n","324: My dress arrived and it looks nothing like the display picture.  The arms had a thin piece of feathery material on them and hung awkwardly on the shoulders.  The dress was not shaped as shown either.\n","325: It was damaged. The sweater fell apart because it was not sewed together\n","326: It was a gift\n","327: This is a nice fit and color and it looks nice and washes up nice\n","328: Comfortable and light. Love them\n","329: Exactly as advertised\n","330: This is a very nice wool cape. I gave it only 4 stars because compared to others I have purchased the material is very thin.\n","331: Nice soft material and color but shows muffin top.\n","332: Wash well, shrank maybe an inch in dryer but they come long so still cover to wear with leggings. Very stretchy and comfy. Colors are still good after several washes.\n","333: Went up a size to XL to fit waist of 32. Weight 190, 5ft7. Comfortable. Linen color has a slight yellow cast. Washed cool water, dryer for 15 minutes and hung to finish drying. No shrinkage or wrinkles. Not as soft as rayon pants but should soften with washes.\n","334: Super cute and so comfy.  Love them!\n","335: My experiences with previous compression socks were not satisfactory. But, I thought I would give these Copper Fit easy on / easy off socks a try. (I even ordered a larger size than the chart recommended.)<br />Well, I found these \"easy on\" socks are just as much of a challenge to get on, as previous compression socks.<br />My guess is the Copper Fit marketing rhetoric (propaganda) will convince many others to purchase & try these.\n","336: I was a bit disappointed with the length; more appropriate for a boy that an adult.\n","337: Fairly sturdy construction. Really cute. Bendable eye stalks and claws. Folds flat for storage.\n","338: Good compression but very thick, not at all sheer or dressy.\n","339: Love them and get lots of compliments on them.\n","340: Good fit and very flattering\n","341: Its adorable but unfortunately it came broke.  The needle was gone so couldn't use it. 4 stars because it is cute.\n","342: Nice fabric horribly shaped.  Very boxy in the hips and bum and I have both but couldn't tell with these unfortunately.\n","343: Thin jacket but adorable.  Goes with anything.  It fit me just right. I love it!\n","344: Honestly I thought I wouldn't be able to fit these when I took them out of the box. Wrong, these fit nicely. Very soft and a good amount of stretch.  Happy with my purchase.\n","345: Great fit. Material is thin, I wear a tank top under the dress. I bought xs, I'm 5'4\" 115lbs.\n","346: Great fit, very comfortable, I have worn twice and received many compliments.\n","347: Bought them for my son who spends a lot of time in the gym. He loved them enough to order another 3-pack in other colors. Definitely his go-to gym shirt now! They are dry-wick, with small, aerating holes in the material. They fit well and move well. He likes the deeper cut on the armholes, as well. Great purchase!\n","348: So it's a beautiful necklace and would have given it 5 stars but Unfortunately I wore it for about 3 hour's and all of a sudden it fell off and I realized the clasp broke.\n","349: The only time I don't use it is when it's in the launfry\n","350: Very pretty, and larger than anticipated. Heavy, so I would wear this on a wool coat lapel. Or a hat brim. Definitely reminiscent of the Victorian era.\n","351: Title says it all\n","352: This dress looks nothing like the picture—badly made & horrible fabric. When you try to return, company makes you pay the international postage—which costs more than the dress! Do NOT buy!\n","353: Poor quality material and craftsmanship. More like a long-sleeve t-shirt than a sweat shirt. One of the hands was sewn onto the shirt backwards! Still waiting to hear from the company on the return.\n","354: LOVE! This is my go-to blouse for everything: business meeting or meeting friends for lunch. SO comfortable and low maintenance. LOVE.\n","355: As described. Great utility work glove.\n","356: Perfect for a little princess. Great material and great fit. I got the 4/5 for my 5 year old granddaughter. She was soooo excited. It twirls, which if you have a five year old princess, you would understand the importance of a twirly dress!\n","357: These polos are cute, comfortable, easy to pull over your head, and the fit and length is great. They paired nicely with jeans. I will probably buy a few more for summer.\n","358: Perfect for my 5yr old grand. This headband is super soft & flexible. No discomfort. She kept it on for the entire visit. Highly recommend\n","359: I used this to make a 15 inch “Big Girl” necklace for my 3.5 yr old granddaughter. She loves the “secret msg” inside and the “beads”. I love the large, thick bail - so easy to add to a necklace or bracelet.<br />I have already ordered another one for my other 4 yr old granddaughter. 5 stars + 👍🏼👍🏼\n","360: Runs small.\n","361: Screws have continously fallen out and I need replacement screws...Are replacement screws available?\n","362: This shirt looks so cute on me! I loved it instantly. It fits really well and the material is a good quality.\n","363: It is very elegant and pretty. I love absolutely it. The words are clear and I think it makes a wonderful gift. It was packed in a beautiful little box.\n","364: Normally I am a happy Amazon shopper but not this time.  My shirt came with a glaring type O stating I'm Only TALKTNG to my Dog so that tells me there is zero quality control.  It's ridiculous.  It's a hassle for me to return and I will NOT order a replacement.  Truly disappointed.  I will say the shirt is a bit cheap but the fabric is soft & if it said what it was supposed to, I would have enjoyed wearing it.  Not going to happen.  This was a dud purchase.  I could forgive if Amazon would send me a new shirt with no type O's cause this one's on you.  Shame.\n","365: Our fast growing 2.5-year-old granddaughter absolutely adores pink & when she saw her new pink shoes (size 7) she couldn't wait to wear them. Thankfully, they are a perfect fit with just enough growing room that she'll be able to wear them for a while. I was pleased to see how sturdy & well made they are, too. These shoes are a great buy for the money.\n","366: Oh my goodness, our 1-year-old granddaughter/princess was uber adorbs all dressed up for her party! ♥\n","367: Very comfortable stretches good hold your booze very well I like the fact that you can adjust the straps in the front\n","368: I bought this for myself, and it is so pretty, and very well made. Get it, you won't regret it!\n","369: Thin, but so soft and comfy! I would recommend sizing up a size if you like a looser fit!\n","370: I paired this big beauty with a rainbow band.  I really love this ring- highly recommend!  Its very comfortable, and the way its cuts makes it extra vibrant.\n","371: It’s not bad quality, it just runs very small and it’s very short. It could just be me, I’m a 36 DD. It would probably work great for an A or a B cup, or someone that has a belly worth sporting...😀\n","372: The earrings came completely broken, no post at all.  I guess you get what you pay for, junk !\n","373: I generally wear an eight, but this was so small you think it was  intended to be a tight dress or something....  not a swim cover up in the least. Bummer because it’s cute, it might fit my nine-year-old niece, but not a grown woman.\n","374: I do have a big chest 36D, 140#, 5'5 The extra large was way too small, I could get it on, but not wearable. Unless you are a beanpol or teen girl, skip this one. The material is nice,, however unless it was drycleaned, I can't imagaine it would wash well.\n","375: Great quality dress. If you are a D cup or bigger, it might be a little tight, but a smaller chest would be perfect.  The fabric has some weight to it, you can feel it’s a higher end dress.\n","376: Beautiful earrings-top notch quailty!\n","377: Really cute-superb quality.\n","378: You get what you pay for...It looks okay, but the fabric is scratchy.  For the price, I suppose it’s not bad if you just want a new look and you only wear the blouse a few times.... I returned it, regardless of the great price.\n","379: I am not a large woman, except for ‘the DD girls.’ I bought a large, but the smooshed look was terrible. One wrong move and I may have busted out of it. If you’re bigger than a C cup,  this blouse probably won’t be a good fit for you. I was so disappointed... Its a simple, yet very elegant look, and the fabric was great quality for the price.  I wish they had an extra large, because it’s truly so pretty.\n","380: I love this skirt! Looks like a few hundred $ piece!, at such a great price. It is not real leather, but it sure appears to be when you are wearing it. I am going back for the other color. It's also very slimming and trendy for the times.\n","381: Very small, I would order up at least 2 sizes. However, it is darling skirt and looks much more expensive than it was.\n","382: Great quality and the royal blue color I ordered was so pretty and vivid.\n","383: Really thin poor quality fabric. Not a good buy, I'd recommend passing on this one. The picture looks much better than the actual product.\n","384: I'd pass on this one.... The material is cheap and the shape is irregular. The fit does not resemble the picture at all.\n","385: They look like plastic\n","386: Chea[p looking\n","387: Very cute dress\n","388: Gorgeous! Great quality!\n","389: Very poor quality\n","390: It doesn't look like the picture it doesn't come with the strings which want fit my daughter\n","391: THIS LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE ITS MORE OF A VELOUR THAN FUZZY.  VERY DISAPPOINTED\n","392: She loves these socks\n","393: Cheaply made\n","394: These earrings are very ugly & its nothing like the picture.  I wouldn't recommend these ugly things to anyone\n","395: I love this shoe\n","396: My daughter loved this\n","397: Great shoe\n","398: I love the color and how it fit\n","399: Loved them\n","400: The material isn’t what I expected. I thought it would be a cotton blend.\n","401: The sunglasses are okay. No better or no worse than competitors glasses.\n","402: Dress a little big. Beautiful dress\n","403: Runs a good two sizes too big.<br />Not flattering at all.<br />The pink is NOT PINK. It’s an ugly washed out pale orange.<br />Sent it back!\n","404: These bracelets are beautiful and wear beatiful\n","405: The earrings are very well made.<br />I hated they would never stay in place.<br />Did not itch\n","406: The shape. I was expecting a different purple\n","407: This GH own is so soft. The color is as expected.\n","408: These items ARE NOT pink !!! They are purple . The quality is not acceptable . Don’t waste your money .\n","409: This dress is terrific. I got compliments from everyone on the elevator. Seriously.\n","410: People love these.\n","411: These dresses are huge! I ordered a smaller size and it still didn’t fit right! Very unflattering! Returned both\n","412: Such a beautiful pin!! Fast delivery with pretty packaging.\n","413: These pants are everything I love about good yoga pants with the addition of pockets!\n","414: This elevates the look of my outfits for sure. However, at the end of the day, I can't wait to take it off. It might be a bit too tight for me.\n","415: [[VIDEOID:9876547d40377bbe96a8059e72cac134]] I love them so pretty and shiny\n","416: 7.5 were too small, gave to a friend who wears size 6.5.\n","417: Washed one time, air dried and ripped.\n","418: Ugly not worth the money sis.\n","419: Vented fabrics, fits great, material comfortable on your skin, well made and the design fits your head and doesn’t slide off. My intention is to wear a face mask and also wear the neck scarf over the mask. Very good price and the UV protection is great as well. Will buy again.\n","420: Delivered promptly. I am most happy that it is titanium. Looks good on my hand.  Very pleased with my choice. Since receiving this ring I have recently purchase again. Awesome quality, design and very comfortable. Thanks. Yep it works.\n","421: Really cute. Soft material, washable.  I like a loose flowing long dress, bought one size up. Accessorise with light peach jean jacket. Great choice for vacation on a cruise. The colour was my main attraction. SO many possibilities.\n","422: I was very surprised they are very attractive once they’re on ,comfortable and they do not fall down.\n","423: Great just ability, good size\n","424: Wonderful material the print is awesome if it is even better thank you\n","425: Warm, fit great.\n","426: This would of been perfect to hold my mask throughout the day. I have to constantly take it off and put it on. Sometimes I put in on the floor and that doesn't help. I bought this to make things easier on me. Howver the material are low quality the straps feel like they will break. And it doesn't stay on the position I left it.\n","427: This bag is......GORGEOUS !!!  Little larger than I expected, but I love it. There is a smell and I am trying what the website tells to do by putting the coffee grounds in it and it worked.  I have gotteb so many compliments on the details and color.\n","428: Came on time, nicely packaged with batteries.  I've been looking for a ct. scale along with grams to weigh my gemstones.  Perfect.\n","429: Works good to glean and Polish silver, gold & gemstones\n","430: Does not resemble the photo in the slightest\n","431: It was way too small. Maybe when I loose a bit of weight I could fit into it. I forgot I ordered it because it too a while to get to me but that ok.\n","432: I ordered a size XL. It was more like a size XS. Couldn't come close to being able to get it on. I know shapewear is supposed to be snug, but the sizing of this product is way off. Made in China but not for American sizes.\n","433: Very happy with this dress.  Not sexy but very comfortable.\n","434: The nubs on these sandals are harder than I expected, and therefore not as comfy.  I did yard in them, I wouldn't be able to tolerate walking the dog in these sandals.  Regular $3 flip flops yes, but not these.<br /><br />They do keep your foot off the sandal, if you are in need of dry feet in a moist environment.\n","435: I bought this beanie for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves the way it feels and the way it fits him! It fits perfectly over the head and the ears so he is always cozy and warm under the beanie :)\n","436: Pretty bracellet & easy to put on, unlike many bracelets.\n","437: Thank you very much I love\n","438: Notice how the cap is on a mannequin? That's because on no adult female would this cal fit as it is pictured. The reviews are either false or written by women who have heads the size of a 4 year old.\n","439: This shirt is super cute and well made. I was very impressed with the quality. I love how it fits. I'm 5'2&#34; and only 100 lbs so even a size small is often too big on me. This short looked like it would be too big when I first opened it, but after trying it on I really liked the way it fit. It is loose fitting and very comfortable. I love the sleeves and the design on front too, and it happens to be my favorite color! It's super cute to pair with either jeans or leggings.<br />*I received this product for free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion. All thoughts and words are my own!*\n","440: Bought as a gift for my mom. The queen bee loved it\n","441: Love this looks so sparkly\n","442: I really love this purse.  It is small which I like but still carries all the items I need.  The gray color goes with everything.  I'm very happy with my purse.  If you want a small purse without a million pockets, this is the one for you.\n","443: not as expected\n","444: The fabric is slightly sheer so I'll wear a cami, and it has a nice drape. It fits but if you want a loose look, (like on the model), order a size up.  The rosey colors are not bright so it looks delicate. It has a casual look yet, it's very feminine, too.  The gathering at the neck line is elastic so it gives it some shape. I like that I can wash it and not have to iron it.\n","445: Bought as a gift for a friend living in a cold and damp climate. I chose the Klimt based on the reviews and I'm sure it'll look good with her more muted color scheme in her home.\n","446: I love these and own three pairs!!\n","447: Nostalgic! Just as described. Very good chain.\n","448: The shirt is way too small, i recommend going up two sizes if you buy it. It doesn't stretch or anything so it's hard to take off.\n","449: Very nice fits great. Very comfortable!\n","450: Perfect. My daughter loves them. They are easy to get on and very warm.\n","451: Exactly what I expexted\n","452: It is cut on one side, did not fot well and looked horrible\n","453: Absolutely wonderful feel and weight. Cozy. It was just too big for me.\n","454: Stitched together well. Bright. Great price.\n","455: I LOVE these rings! The feel, weight and quality is awesome, no defects and highly recommend!\n","456: Comfy light and pretty\n","457: My grandson who is 16 is still hugely into anime. He is going to love these rings as a Christmas present\n","458: I was a little hesitant at first because it doesn’t have a collar, and it’s partially cotton, but it comes up high enough so that you really don’t need one. It’s a really nice sweater, and it’s warm enough too.\n","459: Nice to wear. Show off cat pride\n","460: Works great for virus protection\n","461: These are the most comfortable socks I have worn.\n","462: the top does not sit still and you will flash people\n","463: really delicate and nicely made\n","464: comfortable no front or back so no uncomfortable feeling if you put it on wrong. Strong and lovely.\n","465: I will keep this, but again not a very good fit\n","466: Great pair of cuff links for my husband.\n","467: So small. Tiny is more appropriate. Feel like it's more of a child chain. Disappointed for a special, not wanting anything more from this maker.\n","468: Great fit. Comes to my knee.  Long enough shorts underneath. Not too thick and not too thin. Cute colors and pattern.\n","469: Really nice set of face masks, styles for both me and my hubby. Plus they are bigger so they are not always pulling on your nose. Just remember to hand wash them!\n","470: Easy to wear, dress up or down.  Extremely comfortable.  Have not washed it yet...we will see.\n","471: They work for me when outside doing gardening or watering.\n","472: very easy to put on\n","473: Love these, soooooo comfortable!\n","474: I was afraid it was going to be small but seems to run true to size.Im a 2x and the 2x runs true to size\n","475: Beautiful but very large.<br />Not heavy.\n","476: Would not fit an 8 year old girl.<br />I orders largest size.<br />Cheap material.<br />Too smal. Sizing a joke.\n","477: The size small frame fit my muggle wife quite nice.\n","478: Love them! The calf area is perfect and the foot area is a little big but I just wear my hospital socks, thick with the non-slip on the bottom, and it fits fine! I've used them every time I go outside and they work perfect! Sand and rain are no match for my red boots!!!!' Really happy I can garden and not destroy my other shoes!\n","479: These were for my son and they fit great. He seems to really like them and they look awesome on him. They got here quickly, seem to be holding up really well and are easy to clean. I will definitely have to look for more pairs in different colors. Thanks!\n","480: The size seemed to big and overpowered other charms. And the tiny ring on it broke within a few hours. Not impressed with this one.\n","481: Weird pockets.5\n","482: Took a while to get here,  but it’s VERY nice!!\n","483: Runs small\n","484: Very please with these bags.  Holds lots of groceries.  Very sturdy.\n","485: The teachers loved them! Best gift this year! According to the kids their teachers put them on immediately lol\n","486: I’ve ordered several of this style dress in different prints and this time I decided to go with the tie-dye and it is a totally different kind of fabric that is a little more slinky and form formfitting/stretchy. This particular one is my favorite! It didn’t shrink a bunch when I dried it. The color is vibrant. The fabric is soft and not cheap feeling like the ones with print designs. I’m going to order more of these in solid and tie-dye colors.\n","487: Not bad if you like cheap polyester. Amazon should stop allowing these products on their site.\n","488: This product is a pure fraud. The quality is substandard,  it comes in child sizes even when ordering a large and XL. (I'm medium btw) it is definitely not like the photo. This is the same super cheap crap you find on wish and I would not recommend this to anyone.\n","489: awesome flower girl gift\n","490: The outfit is good quality but, after a few washes, the material starts getting little balls all over it. Also, I suggest sizing down if you like a more fitted look like the picture of the model.  I ordered a size medium I am 55 and 140 lb. The fit was quite loose, more like a large.\n","491: I am happy with the look and quality of these earrings. They will be just darling paired with just about anything. Gives you that POP of red but, not too much!\n","492: Cool looking and comfortable as well as durable.  Holding up nicely 6 months down the road!  Great purchase.\n","493: Absolutely adorable!  My grand daughter loves them.\n","494: These are super cute and lightweight so they are extremely comfortable.  They are larger than a normal safety pin but still cute!\n","495: So cute and comfortable! Will go with everything\n","496: I’m a size 8/29 in pants and normally a medium or large in dresses.  I ordered this in an XL and it was too tight.  The material wasn’t as expected, it felt like a weird windbreaker material and there is no stretch at all.  I returned it because I wasn’t looking for a bodycon dress, but if it were true to size it would have been cute\n","497: I ordered a medium in these and I’m normally a size 6-8, I’m 5’1” and I was worried about these because of my pear shape and bigger butt.  As far as size goes, they do fit as expected, if you’re closer to a 10 you might want to size up - because they have two zippers on the hips and it might be tight.  Giving this 3 stars because the quality is definitely a cheaper material, although very soft and stretchy, they’re really thin and I don’t see them lasting years and years.  Also, the front pockets are great, but the liner on mine shows very easily.  Also, the waistband on the back wasn’t sewn down so I need to tuck it in and be conscious of that, which is a bit annoying.  The length is great for me, but if you’re tall, listen to the other reviewers - they’ll be too short on you.  I could wear these with heels or flats without hemming them.  Great for the price though!\n","498: The fabric is that weird wannabe chiffon and does not look like the model at all.\n","499: These gloves are just a little too long for my hand. They are very warm, just a little long for my hand\n","500: bought 2 pair,fit good ,black& white.both came with front button broke or missing\n","501: really poor design,bad fit,just put in garbage\n","502: A family member asked me to order this for her since I have Amazon Prime. As always, it arrived on time and was packaged well and  in perfect condition.  About a week after I gave her her bras, I checked in with her to see how she felt about them so I could review them.  She said they are 'FANTASTIC' and they fit well.  She was so happy that no wires dig into her and her breasts do not pop out of the cups like they do in some of her other bras.  She found them to be extremely comfortable as well.  When its time for me to buy some new bras for myself,  I'm definitely going to give these a try.  The price is beyond amazing!\n","503: I have stretched ears, which isn’t a problem, but these hoops hang awkwardly and aren’t wearable.\n","504: Super small, tight and short!\n","505: I love Tyvek and Dinomighty but this pouch is a bit oddly shaped, very small and not very useful.  Super cute though, mine holds mints in my purse.\n","506: Boss is Roll Tide Roll and a golfer!  Perfect gift!  Excellent quality; very lightweight and moisture wicking fabric.  He was very pleased!\n","507: Really?!  It’s the size of a silver dollar.  I have to actually shake it for it to come on.  It lights its immediate surroundings and NOTHING else.\n","508: Havent actually printed picture out yet. Bought for nieces wedding. For her bouquet. That was her grandpa can be with her on her special day\n","509: I needed this shirt as part of a work uniform.  Usually an XL fits perfectly. However, not this particular item. Either it runs very small or it shrunk during shipment!\n","510: You get what you pay for ugh\n","511: I got countless compliments on this stunning Christmas pin. By far the best of the 4 I had ordered  for Christmas.<br />Feels like jewelry.\n","512: This material is simply too light for the attractive style. The shaping is good, but it's a bit big and so not attractive.<br />I'm 5'4\" and 163lb - could have sized down. Not sure I'll ever wear. Cannot return as I live on an island.  Pity.\n","513: I love the fabric of these Max Studio tops! The body is waaay loose though, so I ordered XS when I'm really L. The colour is a bit drab, so I've been having a ball dyeing them in various colours. They look amazing. I have at least 10!👍\n","514: I love these earrings. So classy! I ordered them in the middle of a pandemic, expecting to wear them - where???<br />Not sure.<br />All I know is that I'll be wearing them the next chance I get. Maybe next week they will help to jazz up my mask-look!😂<br />The size is modest. They are light-weight and comfortable - totally stunning!<br />Glad I didn't go with several other less expensive options.<br />I will enjoy these classy earrings.\n","515: These are soft and stretchy, but the legs are just TOO TIGHT for the size - cheapens what could have been a great look!\n","516: Very cute shorts, but definitely not for larger girls. Legs are a bit narrow to be flattering. Nice quality!\n","517: This top really looks more expensive than it is. It's much cooler than expected for my tropical climate and is an easy, casual look. I ordered it in 4 colours - all were great except the red - closer to burgundy which I don't like.<br />Order your regular US size\n","518: Very slimming style, but the seam around the round neckline spoiled a great look.\n","519: This is a 'body-con' outfit.<br />Do not order if you have anything to hide.<br />Seriously, I'm thinking one day I will loose enough weight to wear it under a dressy duster jacket?<br />I live on an island, so returns are hard.<br />In the meantime, it goes into my 'waiting' bin😁\n","520: This is a well-made blouse and the fabriv drapes well. I followed the measurements and ordered my correct size ( scroll way down under the item to see specs)<br /> It  fits as per the measurements, but this tyle of fabric looks better a little loose.<br />Definitely going to order more colours.<br />Without pockets looks more expensive I think. I shall get the lighter colours with pockets to hide my bra a tad and wear more casually. Not easiliy wrinkled.<br />I'm delighted\n","521: Was shocked at the quality here. I hate wearing gowns to formal occasions, so was experimenting with jumpsuit options. Slightly large, so will have  it altered to take out the pockets. Hopefully, it will slim my silhouette some.<br />Fabric is quite thick. Nothing sleezy about this! Great\n","522: Very nice fitting. Only cons are the zipper is made with cheap material and the outfit is a little thin. I have had several times where I had to refeed the zipper back together. Otherwise this is a cute outfit.\n","523: They were big for my face so gave them to my mother she liked them.\n","524: I am using this with the yahaira happy butt no 7 works fantastic. Is a must\n","525: I received &#34;blue&#34; and could have sworn I ordered &#34;black&#34;. Keeping them tho . . .  Too much of a hassle to send back.\n","526: Excellent quality, can't beat this deal for the price!\n","527: Smaller then it appears and the chain is short.  But over all still a nice crystal.\n","528: I love the lotus flower.  However I think the chain is a little shorter then 18 inches I purchased a 20 inch to go with it. Other then that it is gorgeous.\n","529: Just as pictured and comfortable. Great for the wood worker in my life\n","530: You get what you pay for. First of all they’re not big....the ones I got did not look like the two toned ones I ordered. They’re flimsy and cheap. I have them to my 10 yr old. Not what I expected.\n","531: I like this a lot! However it does run a little small. I normally wear a size Large and I ordered a XLarge and I’m glad I did.  It’s very nice and soft and a  perfect length. It is also the perfect weight for me as I am always hot so it nice to have a lightweight sweater to wear.\n","532: Nice fabric,<br />a bit large for a small fellow\n","533: The panties fit, comfortable fabric.\n","534: At this moment I am wearing a pair of these pants I purchased at a big box store in Navy color at least 2 years ago or like $12 bucks.  Same pockets, same style --- exactly.  Not 1 lint ball, not 1 tear.  The only place where there's obvious wear is at the bottom, rear heels area.  (And for that area, I always spray with some Shout before I throw them in the washer).  In the years I have had these pants I have probably washed them 100 times.  THEY ARE AWESOME.  So awesome in fact, that they are my ever go to.  I wear them outside in the yard.  I wear them for quick trips to the shopping.  They still look great and hold their shape!  I thought, \"They're getting old and you wear them so much you better purchase another pair now.\"<br />Now to this new purchase.  First, it is next to impossible to find them online and in the stores.  I know because I have been trying.  Second, I paid twice the amount of money for this new pair (which is NOT ALL THE reason I am giving this product a 1 star.  In fact, if they were of the same quality as my first pair I'd gladly - as demonstrated - paid twice as much with zero complaint and a 5 star rating).  BUT THESE PANTS ARE CHEAPLY MADE!!!!<br />The material is so cheap and poorly made... so awful.  I've washed them twice and they already have those unsightly lint balls!  I don't get it.  They look exactly the same but for the color (because NAVY was sold out everywhere).  My level of disappointment in Eddie Bauer is beyond description.  It is at a level that the brand name means poor quality to me such that I will never buy anything bearing it's name.  When you have such a respected brand name, smart manufacturers guard their quality at a nervous, OCD level.  Not Eddie Bauer.  If you've been looking for a second pair of these pants, just be grateful you have 1 already and go to another brand.\n","535: Lightweight and keep my feet dry. Good support without being overly stiff.\n","536: I gave the Teal 5 stars because it is unique - it was not as pictured, it was a light teal with swirls of brown - but after putting it on the chain, it looks great. I Highly recommend - each slice is unique\n","537: Can't say enough about this bracelet - comfortable, adjustable for smaller wrist. I have purchased more for gifts and everyone - from tween on up have loved them.! Beads are just as pictured. Highly recommend!\n","538: returned it\n","539: These really do help with oncoming traffic headlight glare, i use them when I have to drive at night.\n","540: I like the band, but it came with a face plate to match the band that was entirely to big. So pretty much I got a band only. I sure I ordered the right size. My other bands were fine.\n","541: There a tad thigh so of course I were them under a large shirt. Good quality and very soft.\n","542: couldn't be the price and their very pretty!!!!!!\n","543: Great quality leggings\n","544: Too small..\n","545: Looks nice! The leather could be better quality, it feels a little cheap\n","546: I loved the colors but this band kept popping off of my wrist. I wear exam gloves and a lab jacket most of the work day and I would feel it pop off and be laying in my jacket. Even days when I’m sitting at the computer or playing with my toddler, a sudden motion of my wrist and the band would unclip from itself.\n","547: I got these for my husband who mountain bikes 3-4 days a week. he loves them!\n","548: Didn't work on a ring that I had lost that was Sterling Sterling that was very tarnished. Tried multiple times and returned.\n","549: Beautiful watch, horrible craftsmanship. It broke right out of the box. Contacted customer service, they were &#34;out of the band&#34; and said I would have to wait &#34;several days&#34; for a replacement. Then I didn't hear back from them as to if or when they would be replacing it. I would save my money and buy a kid's watch at Walmart.\n","550: Smaller than what I wanted,but good bag.\n","551: Mine weren't broken went I received them but the nose grips keeps falling off.\n","552: Very comfortable!\n","553: Well, I have more curves than this dress will cover.\n","554: The seam on one of the legs started to come undone after only 1 wear and wash. I bought a few other pairs and had no issues with those ones.\n","555: The collar was wider than I thought it would be, so personally didn't like it but it fit fine.\n","556: Read previous reviews that said to order larger then you normally wear. I usually wear a small but I ordered a Large and it fits how I wanted it to\n","557: the balls are barely held on I was hoping they screwed on but they are just pinched in there if ring flexes you loose the ball would not recommend\n","558: Size up if you want the lose for like the picture. This is form fitting at TTS super cute shirt and it is thin. I like it\n","559: Love these shoes!\n","560: Love them\n","561: After reading reviews,  I ordered 2 sizes up.  There is not a lot of support, when I lay down or lean forward,  they fall out.\n","562: Very pretty earrings! I like the concept of the screw on backs, however they do not screw on far enough. With just the screw on back, the earrings hang from my ear and get caught on my hair,  I put the plastic spacer on,  then the screw on back, they fit a lot better.\n","563: I ordered the size I get for similar products, I was able to get it on,  but it was very uncomfortable. Also it rolled.  Perhaps in a larger size I would not have either problem.\n","564: Love them\n","565: It is the exact color as pictured,  the material is ultra thin ! I thought it was a jogging outfit but I was wrong . Size is a bit bigger than you order , just keep that in mind , it's a baggy fit .\n","566: Great buy at a great price and they were packed great!\n","567: Love these fit great and works as described\n","568: Very cute and soft\n","569: I bought this in a medium for my very picky 16 year old daughter. I didn’t have very high expectations because she didn’t pick it out and usually doesn’t like what I pick out. I must say I was surprised when I first saw this sweater. It looks and feels like a sweater that would be in a boutique. It is a good weight and soft...great quality! To my pleasant surprise, my daughter loves it too. She wore it with high waisted jeans with the front of the sweater tucked in, and it looks really good on. I would definitely buy this again!\n","570: Better quality than expected and very cute!!\n","571: Nice comfy light weight t-shirt, took  almost a month to get, due to being shipped from china, wore twice and probably won't get many more wears out of it due to already pilling.\n","572: I was looking for a gift for my brother who loves wildlife, incl moose. It came packaged perfectly and was a very good quality product. Looks like it costs much more than it actually did. The company is the BEST in regards to customer service. They actually emailed me after shipping to me and told me that shipping didn't cost quite as much as they had estimated, so they were crediting my Visa for the difference and they did! That is the type of company I want to deal with. I will certainly shop with them in the future and would tell everyone else to as well.\n","573: wasn't what i wanted\n","574: Perfect in every way.  Thanks\n","575: Was not comfortable\n","576: No elasticity, poorly made & almost see through!<br />I returned them ASAP\n","577: This is more a designer hoodie. I would need to order 2 sizes bigger to fit into one because it's not a normal hoodie. It's soft but again very slim and not stretchy at all.\n","578: I haven't gotten a chance to wear this watch yet, but it looks amazing. I love the sleek black look it has and look forward to wearing it.\n","579: I LOVE THE COLOR!!! The fit is perfect for me and i look forward to buying as many as I can\n","580: Beautiful color and quality but smaller than I imagined\n","581: These shirts are expensive but they wear like iron.\n","582: These are OK. Comfortable.\n","583: Another favorite Hanes seamless wire free bra, love the colors and the fit. I own several!\n","584: These sunglasses are stylish alone and fit over my Rx glasses perfectly if I should wear them that way or wear them alone. They are very light and fit nicely, no slipping. They fit so comfortably, not too tight or too loose. Recommend these glasses and the price is right!\n","585: I do demo work in grocery stores sometimes near coolers or the front door with cold winter air blowing in. This shirt has lots of body with a somewhat thicker knit fabric. I bought a large size, as sometimes medium can be too tight. It fits perfectly, and didn't shrink when washed. The sleeve length is perfect. I am going to purchase another.\n","586: I’m 5’2” and the small was a bit longer than I wanted. The bottom skirt part flares out (like an “A”) too much for me - I wish it was cut to appear straight down. It makes my hips look too wide. Luckily, I sew, so I can make this adjustment to make it more narrow. I was a little disappointed in how wrinkled it was after a first wash, but my trusty iron will handle that. Overall, a cute and inexpensive outfit.\n","587: I wish these pants were available year-round.  My husband lost weight and we needed to go one size down and were only able to find 2 pair of these pants by ZeroXposur.  He needs six pair for work so I am trying to find more in his size before the fall.\n","588: I got this for Christmas from my husband, but I picked it out.  I did replace the necklace due to it only being a 16inch I think (maybe a 17).  I needed an 18inch.  Beautiful necklace though\n","589: Fit as expected, perfectly. Material strong but comfirtable. Elegant lace, not cheap. Absolutely fabulous! Im 5'6&#34;, 175lbs. Very voluptuous. I can wven use thus dress without a bra, thats how supporting the material is!!!\n","590: Its obviously not silver. Didn't expect it for the price. Nobetheless, its pretty and big. I thought it would be smaller.\n","591: I bought 2!  I have grandchildren that come to our house to swim.  I like to have suits on hand and these fit the bill!  The tank style is much more comfortable and there is no pulling or tugging or adjusting.  They are also comfortable enough that they jump out of the pool and onto their bikes without changing!  These are also made of sturdy fabric so they should hold up to wear and tear easily.  I would definitely recommend!\n","592: Nice ring but colors are a little deeper than in pictures if not in direct sunlight\n","593: Great gift for my Grand Daughter\n","594: Great fit, sleeves are a little long\n","595: My husband couldn't get it going so we worked together to get it set up.  Beautiful  Watch!\n","596: Had to return, didn't fit\n","597: This top runs small. I got one just like it from a different seller but with long sleeves and it fit perfectly, so it's frustrating that two shirts that look almost exactly the same and say the same size are in fact different sizes. It's too small to be comfortable so I'll need to lose a few pounds for this one if I'm going to wear it.\n","598: Love these jeans\n","599: Very light and nice to wear\n","600: Soft and wonderful feel\n","601: I don't care for the bulkiness of the clips.  I was hoping for something a bit more \"dainty\".\n","602: These are adorable shoes and I would wear them with leggings any day of the week.  They seem to run just a tiny bit small so depending on your shoe size, you'll want to be mindful of fit.  I ordered a 9.5 but returned for 10.  All good!\n","603: Excellent fit and looks nice.\n","604: Fits perfect.  Looks very nice.  Drapes beautiful and if you accessorize with a complimentary broach, it's a new sweater altogether!\n","605: I could have found better at Dollar tree. Definitely not what i expected. Looks nothing of power rangers. Very cheaply made.\n","606: Cleans shoes\n","607: I love my sweater. It's exactly as pictured. I bought purple and a size down so it would be more snug, it is very, very warm\n","608: I am very happy that this beautiful blouse fits me. I am a size 12 American. The chiffon ruffle is beautiful. The sleeves are a little short, as I am 5'8\"inches. The fabric is different and synthetic. It works beautifully for my Christmas caroling costume as I have a cape to camouflage the fabric\n","609: I love them but I expected them to be a tad larger.\n","610: Love the army green color. Very soft and comfy. I am 5’4 and this hit about my hips.\n","611: My company color is orange. I saw a fellow coworker with this dress on & leggins. I had to order it. I’m a DD chest so everything fits snug up top. But the dress is comfortable. Hugs the waist & flows out.\n","612: they fit great\n","613: For a quick band to switch out while dressing up my other half loves it\n","614: A little bit small but good\n","615: I bought my daughter and son-in-law steam punk items for a fun night out.  This hat fit perfectly.\n","616: Needed a second pair for around the house.\n","617: When is China going to get pur sizes right?\n","618: I get compliments every single time I wear this. I thought it was just a comfy sweater but it's so much cuter in person.\n","619: It was gorgeous for vacation, but it gave me problems and turned green.<br /><br />It kept getting twisted which would cause my belly button to bleed even though I've had my piercing for 4 years. I haven't had this problem with navel jewelry since I first got it pierced.<br /><br />Also, like I said, the jewelry started to turn green after a couple of months. It really irritated my belly button, and I've never had that problem with other jewelry.<br /><br />Seriously doubt it's actually surgical steel.<br /><br />3 stars because it was really cute in my Instagram and Facebook photos for my FL vacation.\n","620: These r adorable.  I've bought these 4 two baby showers and the babies have worn these on every occassion. Both babies are still wearing and into 9 and 7 months from birth.\n","621: I bought this for my husband.  His original CIB is put away for safe keeping.  He commented that this pin is the correct blue color (apparently some are to blue).\n","622: I bought one of these helmets for myself.  My husband tried to \"borrow\" it, but it was the wrong size.  So, I had to get him one!  He's very happy.\n","623: loved these for my work boots!  fit great...wash up nice.  I usually wear 2 pair of footie socks from another store and now that I got these only need 1 pair for comfort\n","624: Comfortable and nicely made!\n","625: THIS IS THE CUTEST LIL RING ESPECAILLY FOR THE PRICE.<br />LOVE HOW IT DIDN'T COST MUCH AND I WAS JUST ABLE TO ADD<br />IT TO ANOTHER ORDER WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL SHIPPING & HANDLING FEE\n","626: I bought two dresses the same size. One fit perfectly but I could not get this one over my head.  The other one that fit-the stitches were coming out. I returned them both. I am leery of buying now because of the inconsistency.  I am sad as honestly I wanted them all.\n","627: What an unexpected joy. These masks are not only stylish but quite comfortable. They fit nicely under glasses without the fog up. I have gotten so many compliments on them. I tell everyone they need to get them. The adjustable ear straps are a bonus. Might just be my favorite purchase yet.\n","628: These are absolutely precious on my 4 year old!  I got a matching pair in my size and I must say, we rock them.  They feel durable and fit as expected.\n","629: This is an AMAZING suit!! I am so glad I ordered it. I am 5ft 4in and 125 lbs. I ordered a Extra large because it said order two sizes up and it fits perfect!! I feel so confident in it.\n","630: These are perfect googles!  My son loses several pairs every swim season, and it was getting way to expensive to replace them all the time.  These are great, work just as well as the expensive pairs at a third of the price!\n","631: Bought this pajama set to wear during my stay in the hospital when having my daughter. I didn't get them out until at the hospital and there is a hole in the pants! It's now too late to return so I'm stuck with them.\n","632: I took the advice from other reviewers, and ordered a 1/2 size larger than my typical size. They fit perfectly! And they are super cute!\n","633: I did not like the material the color was unflattering<br />I usually buy extra small. I’m 5’ 96 lbs and  medium was way to tight\n","634: I’m 95lbs 5 foot 32B bust. The small fit me just right.<br />I like the light weight fabric perfect for summer I recommend this shirt. Well made. Stitching is good quality<br />I also like the shirt goes down below my hips.\n","635: I’m 5 foot 95lbs. I bought a medium. Works well for me as u can see in the picture”s.<br />I recommend buying this shirt. 🙏<br />For the price and delivered to your front door I highly recommend...<br />I’ve boughten quite a lot of tops from patty boukit over the past 9 years and I truly love this one the most😍\n","636: I’m 5 foot  98 lbs and usually wear extra small but this shit was too tight in chest and arms. A medium would work for me.<br />The color is a bit drab sent back.\n","637: Nice quality for price\n","638: Really cute chunky necklace, perfect way to dress up an outfit. Arrived really quickly too.\n","639: Love this hat, purchased one for my daughter and son. She was able to wear it until she was about 5. Love it because it adjustable head size and truly holds the hat in place in the water and a great sun protector. They wash well and hold there color for hears....worth every penny!\n","640: Started with black..added this blue one.  VERSATILE COMFORTABLE AND WEARS GREAT.\n","641: I really like these slippers.  I wear them inside and outside.  Very comfortable.  Would have like more memory foam to last longer during the day, but it is sufficient.\n","642: Loved this so much that I bought one for myself and one for a friend. I would say that these cuff bracelets would fit \"most\" wrist sizes, but if your wrist is especially large I wouldn't purchase it. It's not meant to completely enclose your wrist, but rather  to be open an inch or so in the back.\n","643: Nice gift!!\n","644: So great!! My guy likely.\n","645: Ankle is highly. A little bit uncomfortable. But nice design!!!!\n","646: Shoulder & backline fit a little big.<br />But dress up. doesn't matter. Look is nice!!\n","647: Very colorful, bright and sparkly crystals.  Own several of these and will most likely purchase more.\n","648: I LOVVVVVE these shorts!!! They fit perfectly...very true to size. Even better, there’s no real stretch built in so they hold things in place. I just bought another pair.\n","649: Bags are large and hold a lot. Very sturdy.\n","650: Bought them for my husband he loves them.\n","651: I bought two of these, in black and yellow. They fit very well, easy to button. The material is very light, which is what I was looking for. Color is beautiful, garments seem well-made. I am very happy with these sweaters, and would highly recommend.\n","652: Smaller than expected. Order a size larger. My son seemed to snag them pretty easy. Not sure if that’s the shirt or my son’s fault. Nice value.\n","653: We bought these for my 6 year old who said he wanted something for his ears so he didn't have to hear the baby crying. lol. He does really like them and it doesn't hurt his head. It is adjustable in size. My only complaint is trying to get them to stay unfolded. They fold automatically and will not stay open unless they are already on the head.\n","654: very cute, although it was a little small.\n","655: Love these they are really comfy!\n","656: Very nice. Changing strap configuration didn't work properly (straps and band buckled when criss-crossed). Lace overlay is delicate it's definitely a hand wash item.\n","657: Its a good size! Very nice!\n","658: Love it! All my cards, are in need order. I don't have the worries that I left a card behind.Every card has a slot. The cards that I don't use all the time. I put them on the other side. The key holder is great for my second set of car keys. Lots of pockets. The long strap is great for food shopping. There is no need to put your handbag in the cart. Which is great security wise. I like the soft lining in the bag. And I use this for work and everyday usage. It has really held up. Just an outstanding bag. Thank you!  FYI It took a long time to get to my home.\n","659: Great value for money. Fots on wrist\n","660: Gaming hat for the roblox gamer in your life. She loved it.\n","661: Bought to wear under my sweaters. Love them. Fit perfect. size is as expected.\n","662: Fit great.  Quality fabric but the hood does not come off.  Trending style for teens at half the mall price.\n","663: Very thin and a very shinny---looks a little cheap.\n","664: Love it\n","665: This hook is larger than expected, but other than that great necklace at a great price.\n","666: I love these earings. They are the perfect size and don't weigh too much. In fact they are routinely stolen by my 60 year old mother and 25 year old sister.\n","667: These were a hit with the kids, but the plastic is brittle and breaks easily.\n","668: These are defiantly not the same quality as the real smith lenses. They are much lighter and have a more plastic feel. The mirroring is not as dark which means people cam see your eyes through the lenses when in direct sunlight. That said the lenses have a nice coloring and are very clear. I would buy these lenses again especially because Smith does not make these glasses anymore.<br /> That said the\n","669: A nice sugar free addition to the Halloween candy bowl!\n","670: Love the look of the shoe.  Can wear them about a 1/2 day before they hurt my feet.  Very stylish!\n","671: This was very pretty. I read the reviews and bought a size bigger. I wish I hadn't. It was too big.<br />I have an hour glass shape and this dress was not flattering on me.\n","672: Great bow tie and color..\n","673: great product and looks good worn too.\n","674: My grandson loved these pajamas! Catboy is the current favorite!\n","675: These are so pretty and do not weigh down my earlobes. Like the way they sparkle too. And they will not tarnish!\n","676: These are too small, the material is thin and cheap, and the storage bag is not attached as other bags used for grocery totes are. I don;'like them.\n","677: Very scratchy and hard lace.\n","678: Super nice quality and in a set of four pairs too! I recommend.\n","679: Cte, but took a very long time to ship.\n","680: Very nice. Very nice, indeed!\n","681: Junk. Garbage. Spray painted plastic trash.\n","682: Kinda stiff. Knee length. Not that soft\n","683: item very heavy and slides to front of my neck all the time, and necklaces still tangle\n","684: Love these luggage tags. It all, I have purchased about five sets of this type from this company. Quality is excellent for fake leather, and the older ones I have have stood up well too many trips through the baggage carousel.\n","685: This cape is  everything I wanted. The weight is not too heavy, not too light; the drape is beautiful; the interior finishing is perfect; and the color is a gorgeous hazel that complements almost any outfit.<br /><br />Some reviewers have expressed disappointment that the cape is not of a heavier fabric. Please keep in mind that full, long capes like this involve a lot of fabric – – if the fabric is much heavier than this, then the garment is overwhelmingly heavy. Also keep in mind that this kind of shape allows you to wrap it around your self sort of double if you are cold.  It also allows you to wear a layer or two underneath in colder weather. For this reason, I adore this item for travel to changeable climates.  And it looks amazing with tall boots!\n","686: Very cute, with a quality look.\n","687: Nice, inexpensive birthday gift for teen girl. Teens love things that are personalized.\n","688: I gave them away because even with the stretch they wouldn't fit.  I ordered a size bigger than I take and they were still too small.\n","689: This was a great bag, but it ended up being too big for what I was looking for. I feel like the measurements in the description were off slightly and I also gauged the height of the bag wrong. Outside of size, this seemed to be a really nice purse and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something in this size range. Item was returned but because of the quality from the brand I intend to look for another purse of the same brand.\n","690: Arrived well packed and on time. Good quality for a fair price. My only complaint is that they're smaller than other readers I've bought - I've attached a photo of the round rimless with a pair of cheapie readers recently purchased from my local Wal-Mart. I'll keep them and wear them anyway - I can live with the small size and will update my review if they don't survive.\n","691: Love my band.  Easy to put on my watch.  I get lots of compliments on my pretty watch band.\n","692: Love this sweatshirt, its very comfy.  I wasn't sure of the sizing so I went bigger to have it loose but its a little too big so I don't think you need to size up for it to be loose fitting.\n","693: Love this top.  Fits well and good quality.  I would recommend.\n","694: Very nice shirt, fits well and is comfortable.  It definitely doesn't look like the pic on me but still nice.  I would recommend.\n","695: Fit is pretty good, ran a little small.  Looks good and is very comfortable.\n","696: These are very nice earrings.  Not as substantial as I had hoped but they look good and I will wear them.\n","697: Great sweater.  Fits well.  It did shrink a little when I washed and dried so it lost a little of its &#34;looseness&#34; at the bottom.  It still fits and I will continue to wear.\n","698: Great bag.  It is a good size, it is big and holds a lot which I like.\n","699: I love this jacket.  It was exactly as described.  It is quite loose as noted, it is not a fitted jacket.  I found that it fits just as it looks in the picture.\n","700: Great robe.  Very comfy and roomy.  It is soft and a perfect weight for a summer robe.\n","701: This is very nice! Very soft and comfortable too. I got complements on it the first time I wore it!\n","702: This is a pretty shirt. Cool for the summer and looks cute on!\n","703: This was a Christmas present for my daughter and she loved it!! So do I!!\n","704: I could have swore I purchased a different brand, but no matter.  The material is great, so soft, nervier wrinkles.  The fit is perfect.  The length is right at the ankle and I am 5’9”.  So it’s perfect.<br />My only drawback on these pants would be the pockets.  They are odd.  They are not placed well or the shape is wrong.  They do buckle a bit which I do not like.  I am not a fan of pockets any way and these are just not flattering.  I am a seamstress as well and I will figure out what is wrong and correct it. Other than that the pant fit well.\n","705: The color is love, a muted pink shade.  The blouse fits fairly well except the sleeves rug short and the waist is large.  The size charts is off.\n","706: Fits way too large around the waist.  It the material is lovely.  The dress flows and drapes well.  I hand washed this dress and hung to dry it came out well.  I am going to try and wash in on the delicate cycle in the washing machine and I hope it doesn’t pill.  Will size down with next purchase.\n","707: Cute cami.  The armhole is a little long, but if you adjust the spaghetti straps too much then you lose the lovely V-neck cut\n","708: Fit my granddaughter perfectly\n","709: Beautiful color.  Size is right on, no wiggle room.\n","710: A great shirt but the sizing is weird.  Does not fit the  U.S. size chart.  My husband is 6’1” 160 lbs.  and I ordered their size Large and it fits perfectly.  Hope it doesn’t shrink when I wash it.<br /><br />I wish these companies that want to sell their product  in the  U.S. would get a clue and use the U.S. standard sizing.  This would cut down on disappointment and costly returns and delays.  Anyone agree give a shout out\n","711: Great sock for low rise boots\n","712: First of all the mentioned elastic at the waist is not there you will find it just under the boobs.  Not what I wanted.  I expected to have a dress that was a little more form fitting instead of a 70 year old  in a maternity dress.  Think about it.  It gave me a laugh.  But with these foreign purchases you never know what their English translation will mean.\n","713: Like B. Unique.  The only problem with This pair of shoes is the strap was very very  short.\n","714: Too much material in the front of pants\n","715: I ordered the purple color but when it arrived it was more of a reddish color.  Not what I needed\n","716: I wanted this dress so badly but the fit is awful.  I believe the size chart needs to be reevaluated.\n","717: Too small in the bust area. Too small from the top of the shoulder to below the bust. Gave it away instead of returning it\n","718: Does not stay in place, even with the anchor tape.  Priced too much for the poor job that it is supposed to do.\n","719: Nice print, fits well but the shirt material could have been better quality.\n","720: Makes my husbands jeans look like they’ve been to the cleaners!\n","721: Awesome quality\n","722: Absolutely Love This Coat very warm and the 1 thing that I really love is it is 2 Jackets in 1\n","723: This is perfect as a liner under another coat when incredibly cold outside, or use in milder weather by itself.\n","724: Use this for a key to my shed, looks great.\n","725: Bought an XL. Just barely fit over my chest and is very short plus tight. Was told I looked like I was wearing a kids shirt.\n","726: It smells so bad and is way bigger then it looks. Also hard to get cards in and out. I would not but this again.\n","727: Does a good job for the price.\n","728: Besides being pretty it covers my face more and more efficiently than standard masks.  Adjustable ears straps easy to slide and they stay in place.  Would buy again. Very nice product.\n","729: This hat is adorable, made very well and I imagine very warm. BUT it is definitely made for a child. My head measures 21&#34; and I could just barely pull it down to my ears. The color is pretty but not as vibrant as my monitor shows.  This will go to my 9yr. old grand daughter.\n","730: Beautiful and of good size and quality. I did have to buy a chain extender but that is no big deal.  Received it quickly, wrapped securely. Will buy more jewelry form this company if they ever become available.\n","731: Gorgeous pillow of exquisite quality.\n","732: Very impressed with the comfortable fit! Fabulous colors and fabulous seller!\n","733: Too tight.\n","734: the scarf is very nice and soft...full size\n","735: These are lovely. Just what I wanted to match a necklace.\n","736: It comes as one solid piece. Less connections to break. Bought for a kid joining the military. He loves them.\n","737: This natural stone bracelet is looking amazing! I like the light blue color and it’s great for daily wear. It’s fashionable and it is comfortable to wear\n","738: I got this bracelet for my mom and she loves it! It’s beautiful and each stone is well picked. And the design is amazing! It goes with all her outfit!\n","739: The tote bad is beautiful! I love the color very much. It’s not Snow White but has the nature of white in it, which is chic. The bag can fit in anything I carry on a daily basis. And the design is amazing!\n","740: Pretty comfortable and stylish shirt. I like the blue color and strap design. The fabric is a little stiff, which is the reason why I give it four stars only. Hopefully it will get softer after I wash it.\n","741: Love this fashionable Japanese style shirt. The design so detail oriented, and it looks so nice on me! Love it!\n","742: Love this crystal watch, as it looks so expensive and good quality. It is beautiful and elegant! My mom is very happy about this order!\n","743: This shirt is very stylish, and it fits me very well. The design is fashionable, and perfect for the work out time. It stretches very well and feels totally airy. Love it!\n","744: Love this 100% cotton shirt. The fabric is such great quality. The true red is very appleaing! Love it and can't wait to wear it when I go out!\n","745: It is a very affordable watch, but it does look expensive. The design is simple yet sophiciated. It will match all my outfits. Love it!\n","746: I recently want to try some classic streetwear. I got these pants and love them. The color is very fashionable, and they could go with any shirts and footwear I have. Cotton blend material is comfortable and airy. Overall, these pants are amazing!\n","747: I live on Oahu, and the rainbow is common to be seen here. I got my mom this rainbow bracelet and the design is so cute and gorgeous! It is light and fashionable.\n","748: The robe clung to me and  was too small. I threw it away cause I  can't return it. I am so disappointed.\n","749: Gave it away\n","750: I would not buy again.\n","751: Weird fit. Decent quality\n","752: Returned this because it was too stretchy so it was too big for me.\n","753: Didn't care for this style. It was snug as are most Wacoal bras.<br />This style gave me a somewhat &#34; pointy&#34; look.\n","754: Does the job. Fits my large calfs quite well.\n","755: The fit was perfect and they feel very nice and soft. Just used for wearing around the house. Some have complained that they are transparent but mine are not at all.\n","756: I like the design  of the pendant !\n","757: I like  the design and intricate detail I wear this with anything in my wardrobe\n","758: This was advertised as an XL hat.  It was so tight that it was uncomfortable, and I don't have a big head.  I returned it.\n","759: Very comfortable and warm for wiinter.  Ran a little big, but the length is nice and long to keep your backside warm.\n","760: Love these earrings real easy clasp you do not have try to catch it in back just hooks snaps worth the money.\n","761: I've bought these several times now for party favors, stocking stuffers, easter happies, and to send to school for class \"treasure box\".  Fun and a great bargain!\n","762: I bought two of them.  They look great, wear well and at the same time bought my son an Invicta for $85 he wanted.  This watch is better looking.\n","763: just what i wanted\n","764: Husband warm for a Halloween costume – he was Granny that the wolf ate\n","765: Seem &#34;cheap&#34;. Way small\n","766: I'm only 5'4'' but this comes above my knees - and I don't like that.  I'm going to add lace or a layer of fabric.\n","767: I truly love these earrings.. color is soft and beautiful and I am very happy with them and highly recommend this dealer.\n","768: Great handkerchiefs.  Good designs and a generous size.\n","769: I had to return these because I couldn't get the collar to lay down,  the collar is cute up, but it drives me nuts.<br />The tops are really well made, I bought blue and red, I wish they had worked for me\n","770: My husband uses these to keep facemasks on because they're more comfortable than traditional extenders. Has used them for sunglasses also\n","771: This is my fav hat. So inexpensive and cooler because of the light coloring\n","772: Very comfy\n","773: Perfect!! Comfortable, lite, fits like a glove...\n","774: It was exactly as promoted and displayed:) Recieved as agreed!!:) Easy to order:):)! Exactly what I needed...\n","775: Very nice for a graduation gift!\n","776: Very soft.  I like it a lot.  Perfect length for me (and i'm 5'5&#34;).  After wearing again, I realize that it does run a little small.  Not enough for me to return it, but definitely order a size up.\n","777: Nice bag, but the only downside are the zippered sections on the front.  I find that they really do not want to open, the zipper sticks and doesn't want to open.  When I persisted and got one side open, I found you really couldn't put anything in there anyway - it's too tight.  As decoration, it adds to the look of the bag, but I was hoping for a usable outside pocket.\n","778: Great for the price.\n","779: Color was as represented. Fit and length was perfect for me. Would buy again.\n","780: As always Patty Boutik doesn’t disappoint but this has got to be my favorite piece of her’s so far.  The material is SO soft but not only does it fit z woman’s body perfectly but the contrast stitching outlines my silhouette magnificently.  I have now bought this in 2 colors for my daughter in law and this is my third color.  Good thing I see lots of different people so they don’t get tired of seeing me in the same (different color) all the time because I always feel fabulous and can count on at least 1 compliment with each wear!  Love Love Love!!\n","781: This mannequin works great. Allows the jewelry to be the focal point and almost faded into the background verses the standard black mannequin. I will purchase again.\n","782: The shirt work rate. Our daughter is in the 40 percentile for her age so she is on the smaller side. Because of this the shirt was a little long. But it still looked wonderful.\n","783: Worth the money, but pretty cheap looking.\n","784: Brought 2 different colors. Yellow and Green durable and easy to tie. Soft. Totally recommend\n","785: Sizes were ridiculously small, I returned all. Very Cheap quality.\n","786: Comfortable slipper. However, the back is not that high and crushes down while wearing. Simply put, the back should either be high like a full slipper or totally eliminated like a slip on to be more comfortable.\n","787: It works, but you have to be faithful and use it regularly.  It does what it suppose to, it even fits good under garments!  Which I really like.\n","788: I ordered what I thought was the appropriate size using the manufacturer's chart. It was so small I couldn't possibly try it on..\n","789: Very nice and well made pin.\n","790: Good pressure\n","791: Not as described at all. This shirt can NOT be worn off-shoulder. The neckline is a standard t-shirt fit and it does NOT have bat-wing sleeves. This is basically just a plain white tee and 100% NOT what they are advertising. Super disappointing.\n","792: I love these glasses! The red is really cool, chic & flattering! They are VERY sturdy & well-made. Like the tortoise she'll too. There's something for everyone's taste. I know I'll wear every pair. They grey is really nice, sort of a transparent grey-blue which is beautiful. Then there's the standard black, which you pull off & look so very good lol.<br />I highly recommend the case. It's really well made, has a cleaning cloth & is very versatile, attractive & sufficient to protect a pair carried in the depths of my purse. It is black with a large band of red down the top. Of course there are different colors available, but I'm very apply with the red & would buy it again & recommend it highly. I love that I could get the coke bottles that I need to read 5.0 & they don't look like coke bottles. All in all a solid hit. Love the. Oh the lenses are very clear, like crystal. Love love love!\n","793: Ok, I read every review for these earrings & i have to comment. First: they are big: yes they are! They are very big! Is that a surprise? Shouldn't be! Just look at he dimensions! They are that big! It shouldn't be a surprise! I love the size! I am a judge Milan fan; check out her earrings & she is a classy lady! Second: cheap appearance. They DO NOT look cheap for the price! In fact, it's quite a feat to create such nice looking earrings for sooo very little money! I am not going to wear these to a big formal affair (although I would not be ashamed to do so( but I will wear them pretty much for everyday, lunch with friends, shopping visits, doctor visits, etc. third: they are too heavy! O my i must vehemently disagree! These earrings are very light & cause NO discomfort at all! I am exceedingly sensitive to heavy earrings. These earrings, surprisingly are comfortable enough to sleep in and are whisper soft. I have. No problem with a review that accurately reflects the cons of a piece. However, none of the complaints listed herein accurately reflect the problems of these earrings. I have tried to completely & fairly represent these earrings. They are very inexpensive , but you get a lot of bang for your buck! I DO wish Amazon would give us some choices! At least 10k maybe 14k since gold prices have dropped so significantly!  Are you listening Amazon buyers? Also, bring your prices back down to a deal cause you now cost significantly more than the products available in local stores!\n","794: Bought as a gift for my Mom and she loves it.  Thumbs up!\n","795: The orange is more of an 'electric salmon' - a smidge of pink undertone, not a 'safety orange' hue.<br /><br />The green is exactly what I wanted; my kid is obsessed with this color. He's a mens 7.5 and these are really almost too short/small. I've stretched a tiny 'run' into one on the first attempt at putting his socks on him. I'd definitely say these are sized more for womens feet, specifically the typically smaller womens sized feet found in the country of manufacture (the average womens shoe size in the US is either an 8.5 or 9 and in Asian countries I believe i read it's more like a U.S. 5 or 5.5.).<br /><br />Can't comment on the compression value unless they calculate compression value with algebra, spandex percentage and the foot size the socks are manufactured for 🤷🏼‍♀️\n","796: This was the first time I used these elastic watch bands.  Super comfortable.  I use it to play tennis.  Fits the watch nicely.  However, it does show dirt.  I haven't washed it yet, but assume it's going to come out.\n","797: I love these! I have many of them in different colors\n","798: Love these crazy round oversized pink sunglasses! So much fun to wear!\n","799: Cute scarf. I wear as a scarf and use as a belt.\n","800: So I loved how these looked, and the fit was perfect, however two of the butterflies gems just fell out after wearing them a day or two. They were not expensive so I'm not really complaining, but if they just held together my rating probably would have been 5 stars\n","801: Great thin undershirt. Fits snug and good to work out in and wear in general.\n","802: I ordered these for my Mom; she had no idea how to use them and neither did I. I'm returning them\n","803: Husband loved it!  Very Nice belt\n","804: I love the idea of the necklace but it's just weird. It doesn't lay flat across my chest and the ribbon started to fall apart the first time wearing it. Awful!!!\n","805: love these glasses!<br />They are actually my 2nd pair, I bought my first pair @tylers. They are awesome quality and durability, they stay on while I’m playing sand volleyball; they are also very light. I also like the nose piece, it does not leave prints on my nose or get stuck in my hair when I rest my glasses on my head.\n","806: Watch band started losing color within 1 week of having. Terrible quality and color isn’t as vibrant as discerned.\n","807: LOVE IT\n","808: So I read that these run small, and therefore ordered a 40, whereas I'd normally go with a 39. Glad I sized up, my toes had just the right amount of room. They are surprisingly comfortable, especially the nicely padded insole which actually offers a bit of arch support. I guess it's the knit sock, but they feel nothing like you'd expect plastic shoes to feel, and that's good! That said, they still LOOK like jellies in that they're kind of shiny. That shininess kind of turns me off, it just reminds me of galoshes or something. I'm keeping them because I desperately need some flats that have arch support, but I don't think I'll order more - just not my thing.\n","809: Great product!!\n","810: This is a nice product, but I am not convinced that I &#34;love it&#34; yet. It makes me look pregnant or that I am trying to hide my belly. Of course, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, I just get self-conscious with no &#34;form&#34; to the bottom of a shirt. I needed this for a trip I am taking and it seems like it would dry easily, so I will take it with me. But I plan on sewing the neckline in a bit, it's too open for my taste, so I will sew the bottom of the V together about an inch or more, as there are no buttons. The material is not thin, seems like good quality.\n","811: This pendant was lovely, shiny and larger than I thought, but the person I gave it to was happy. It is closer to being the size of a nickel than a dime.\n","812: Sized up but it wasn’t enough. Returning for a bigger size\n","813: Though these are incredibly pretty, I didn’t realize they were not internally threaded (which is what I was looking for). I got caught up in the barbell on each side and the color lol. Good product though\n","814: I’m a curvy girl and these fit great\n","815: I went up two sizes and it's still a little small. I also wish there was a little more fabric on the bottom to give it more of a romper feel than a onesie.\n","816: Great colors, just thinner than I'd like\n","817: Pretty well made. I wear it every day and it is only just starting to show wear on the edges after about two months.\n","818: It came jus as it was suppose tood\n","819: I ordered several items to help my mother-n-law after elbow surgery. Most worked, a few needed to be returned and this was the only one that would not allow me to return it, even in a pandemic and the package isn't opened. Can't tell if it was a good product, but an expensive one if you aren't sure.\n","820: Not much more to say. These were a great find.\n","821: This dress is see thriugh. The fabric is thin and very poor quality.\n","822: It is a nice simple scarf that accents what you wear without over doing it.\n","823: I love this! Mine got really shiny shortly after wearing it. It  draws a lot of attention i get a lot of compliments on it.  This is a great piece to have if you are looking for a piece of jewerly to wear all the time.\n","824: I first worried about it being a fake because I have real moldavite that pulsed in my hand and got hot within five minutes and I didn't feel that. After about twenty minutes I felt pulsing that went into my chest then spread into my shoulders. It is thin I am afraid to drop it because it will break. I am sadisfyed with it over all.\n","825: This is a gift for my mom. She loves larimar.\n","826: I bought this for myself and another for a gift.<br />Very loose but I only wear around house so no problem.\n","827: Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  However, it did not work.  Window to return has closed.  Waste of money!\n","828: Looks great with jeans or leggings and I am tall.  Hits me at thigh level.\n","829: I am tall and this dress did not fit right.  It is too big in the top.  And I am chesty.  In order to get the chest in the right place, I had to pull the halter straps tightly then the waist band was under my bust.\n","830: Bought these for my granddaughter and she wore them once.  The size is a bit small.  No padding in the back of the heel and the shoes rubbed blisters on her heels.  Luckily, she was at summer camp and changed into her flip-flops.  Promptly went into the Goodwill bag.\n","831: Stone is loose and rattled when worn\n","832: looks very cheap\n","833: Just what I expected for my wallet.\n","834: Very nice quality. Nice size. Lovely gift box. Worth every penny.\n","835: This product is a hoot!!  It is so funny-looking that my grand-kids pretend they don't know me when I wear it fishing.  It is fairly cheaply made, but I think it will be okay if I don't treat it too roughly.  And on top of all that, it does the job!  I use it mostly for shade, and haven't tried it in the rain.  I love that I \"take the shade with me\" when I am wearing it.  Sometimes I wear it while working in the yard.  Great idea!\n","836: This is a very heavy weight warm sweatshirt! I've had it for a year now and it has held up great! I hang it to dry... I ordered it huge and it has stayed huge and wonderful. It's my inside the house where I keep the thermostat at 65' survival garment. I can pull the sleeves down over my hands - at the same time the cuffs have enough elastic to stay in place if I push the sleeves up.\n","837: measurements in size chart do not correspond with product measurements.  beautiful pajama set, however.  Deciding whether to return or gift to someone.\n","838: These are great for summer wear. Look nice and comfortable.\n","839: Could be cut a little wider but nice\n","840: Threw it away, fabric cheap.\n","841: I bought these shies for my grand daughter and she loves them!\n","842: The fit was not ad expected\n","843: They are long and fit perfect\n","844: looks great, very small size.\n","845: The fabric was very soft, and the colors were true to the picture. Purchased this as a gift, and it was very well received! Gloves and hat both fit as expected.\n","846: Decent dress,  needed a significant amount of altering upon receipt.  One of the two came with what looked like an extra boob cup sewn below the two cups.  So, since neither my friend or myself have 3 breasts, one of them had to be removed at our cost to make the dress wearable.\n","847: Was not expecting to have to do watch band surgery when i ordered this band.  The material feels lovely against my skin, but the entirely ineffective instruction card that came with the band is telling me to fit the band to my wrist by cutting off chunks at a time and replacing the metal clips.  Unless there is a YouTube tutorial where i can see what needs to be done they seriously need to reconsider selling these online.  They need to be sold in a store where someone trained can size the band for you.\n","848: I have only worn it 5 hours but the comfort is like any other ring. It is exactly as pictured in the description. The fit is perfect, so go with whatever your normal size is.<br />Can not speak to tarnishing or greenfingers yet, but it looks lovely on the hand! I will update this if any issues occur.\n","849: I didnt lay it out perfectly in the pic, but the product is as shown. I usually wear a Small (am 5'4\" 117ish lbs) but got a Medium just in case it shrinks. Without shrinking its a little baggy but not enough that it looks silly. Overall, worth the purchase, as this price rocks compared to other online sellers selling the same cardigan for more!\n","850: The fabric is thinner than id thought. The colors are also brighter than in the picture-- more vibrant/bright than the jewel toned rich colors they had appeared to me in the pics above. Is as long as id thought tho-- im 115 lbs 5'4\" and Small hits right above my ankles.\n","851: Very pretty!\n","852: ****UPDATE****<br />In my initial review(below) I had given these high marks and five stars.  Today, upon trying on my second pair (in black) I downgraded these due to lack of consistency.<br /><br />I initially got the faux snake style.  Different color but same shoe.  However, the black ones are not nearly as great. The sole feels like a regular shoe not anywhere as soft cushy and comfy as the first ones I bought just a week ago.  Disappointed.<br /><br />**********************<br /><br />I am still in awe of how these work.<br /><br />I feel like I just bought magic shoes!<br /><br />I have not been able to walk like a normal human for months now...I reluctantly ordered these sandals.<br /><br />After having spent a small fortune on a sleep boot, plantar fasciitis socks, foot insoles, cold packs, cold socks, warm socks, special running shoes, etc nothing even touched the pain.  Zero relief with all those things I bought before.<br /><br />These shoes.  Magic.\n","853: For school play.\n","854: Horrible shape... makes you look like your nipples are showing... or like you have 2 on each side,  dissappointment... Don’t waste your money!\n","855: I have already noticed that my feet sweat significantly less when I wear these socks. I have no idea why, but the claim is true for me. I accidentally dried them and they did shrink but I have really small feet.\n","856: If you like Buff, do not expect these to be the same. Much thinner. Fit is not as good nor as nice in feel. If you want cheap. This is your deal.\n","857: I really like chokers to dress up casual jean outfits.  I only tried a few of these, but every single one broke as soon as I clipped it on.  They really look nice, but are not durable.\n","858: I had a necklace that was too short and this worked perfectly to extend it.\n","859: Nice feel but a little larger then I expected. Since it is compression I thought it should have a tighter fit.\n","860: Very attractive looking glasses, seem to curb my eye strain from hours of video gaming and/or using my laptop. I even like to wear them when I'm not using screens as fashion glasses. They fit both me and my husband and are of a good quality- I'm not worried about breaking them with every day use.\n","861: I got so many compliments it's ridiculous! Flattering for any body type as the empire waist it's super dramatic but does hide any potentially bloating, neckline is not too low, & length is perfect. Split in the middle is not drastic so it does not fly apart easily but if you are looking for your leg to show even when not walking that will not really happen. Would buy in all the colors!\n","862: This dress is so cute & fit perfectly however the split in the front is dramatic so if you're not paying attention & a good breeze kicks up you may be showing off a little more than planned... Proper undergarments are a must!\n","863: They do not keep feet as warm as hoped.\n","864: They fit as expected and look great.  They are strong for leggings.\n","865: It is made pretty well\n","866: LOVE these earrings!  They are really pretty, not too large, not too small, and really fine craftsmanship!  Am planning to buy a couple more pair as gifts for the holidays.\n","867: Love this!!!!!\n","868: I ordered one of these tops as a gift and upon seeing how well the product fit, I ordered two more tops to use as gifts.  Good choice of color combinations as well.\n","869: Within 2 weeks and 4 days of wear the watch completely stopped. I am majorly bummed because I wanted a decent looking pocket watch but should have realized that this price to look was too good to be true\n","870: I returned the watch did not like it. So I sent back the band it fit good and was a good band but would not the other watch I got.\n","871: Good leather a little stiff at first but it is breaking in fine, good leather is that way.\n","872: Have this to my boyfriend and he loves it.\n","873: Ok first when I opened the box I noticed they were bent. I have some m readers that are,great much better than these. They are,cheap made  flimsy. Small at least compared to other reader.\n","874: My husband is a non-sadal wearer and he wore these comfortably. However, they failed to make an avid sandal wearer out of him.\n","875: Good Quality<br />As described<br />Boyfriend loved as a valentines gift!\n","876: Really nice . I love it .\n","877: Very nice ! Love it .\n","878: My daughter really likes it.\n","879: The color is more of a peach color instead of pink.  It wasn't actually what I wanted.\n","880: Was shipped faster than the original date, outside package well done and protected.  Upon opening the envelope, I found a gift box but when I opened the box I found a small 1.5\"x2\" envelope with the necklace inside all tangled and  knotted up which took me over an hour to get all the knots out. The heart is  pretty but a lot smaller than the picture makes it appear.  Chain so delicate and clasp so tiny it would  be difficult for a normal person to put on themselves or someone else.  Very easy to break the chain due to it being so delicate. Chain in ad states a length of 17 inches but when I measured it , I barely got it to reach the 16\" mark. It looks more like something a child would wear but is far to delicate .  I am not sure whether I will spend the money to return it or just keep it and call  it a loss. It is not something I would ever buy for myself as if it ever caught on something, it would not be worth repairing if it could even be done.\n","881: Great product  Great fit.  Sizing is perfect\n","882: The necklace itself was pretty. It certainly didn’t look real, but it has an interesting shape and sparkle and makes for a nice statement piece.  I think it will look nice up against high necklines of a solid color or a lower neckline just against your skin, check the length to make sure it will hang right.<br /><br />The reason I knocked off a few stars is that The one is received was broken. One of the smaller side chains that connected to the outter most chai was broken and hanging. I considered keeping it and fixing it (I probably could have re-attached it with glue), but it’s ridiculous to spend money on something that is broken. I’m not sure how durable the piece is, so that may become an issue down the road if you purchase this. If you happen to get one that is not broken, it’s quite pretty.\n","883: I ordered this dress in yellow for Easter Sunday. The color was gorgeous. It is a nice bright and sunny yellow - just like the picture shows. The problem with this dress is the fabric. If it had been a bit thicker, it would have been perfect. As is the dress is a thin spandex feeling material - picture thin workout leggings. This makes the dress cling in ALL the wrong places. It literally settled into every bump and crevice on my body. Spanx could not salvage this dress (you could see every spanx line too!) This went back post haste. I suppose if you go up a size or pick a darker color, it might work....\n","884: Item is shrunken sizing. Way too short and way too small. Child size chart is not accurate and should be be banned from marketplace!<br />Very deceiving! Causing a purchase that you have to PAY TO RETURN!!! Useless item!\n","885: Purchased for my 92 yo mother and she loves them.  What is shown is what you get.<br />I am a little concerned about the very thin necklace. I think it could be a bit thicker\n","886: These bracelets are perfect for friends. They’re so nice and they’re easier to adjust.\n","887: It didn't work when I recieved it.\n","888: They are sturdy, but light weight. Color is spot on.\n","889: fit perfect! Wear a M and ordered a M. They actually stay on when I bend over and are not see through. Very warm too. Bought 2 more pairs\n","890: just fine - finally found what I was looking for\n","891: Boots arrived in great condition and fit wonderfully!\n","892: Great value and easy to attach.\n","893: very comfortable\n","894: Love these just wish I could find more in the low cut like these, so tired of boring white socks\n","895: These goggles are great!  they are very well made and the optics were exactly what I was looking for\n","896: Lightweight, great for a quick trip out/to the beach. If you dont like the tag it comes off easily and doesnt leave a mark\n","897: Greta wardrobe addition for travel. I am not the type to like not wearing socks with sneakers etc, and these are a great compromise, covering up to the ball of your foot, they eliminate heat and friction I would otherwise experience without socks. great buy\n","898: Bought as a gift and he really loves them.\n","899: This was an impulse buy but boy! did I make a good impulse decision!! The kimono is absolutely gorgeous! I love the black and gold color. I think I'll wear the black side out, I think the gold side will startle my roommates :-).<br /><br />Very comfortable. I am short a 5'4 guy and the length is perfect for me.<br /><br />I wish it had a few different options to tie the loop, right now, there's only one belt loop.\n","900: Very hard to screw end on.  Screw come loose then lost.\n","901: I received a pair of boots that were purchased on line that were supposed to be dark brown, and were not.  I contacted the company about the mistake, and if I could replace the boots. Apparently the supplier had gone out of business. Rather than accept the refund, I decided to die the boots to the dark brown color of color of Kelly's Leather Die and the Nugget Brown Cafe to get the desired result, I was looking for.  It worked!\n","902: The material inside the shirt is extremely itchy to me even after washing. Had to return it.\n","903: I found the inside material to be so itchy. I had to return it. Also, a small would have fit me better.\n","904: Cute, fits great and very easy to care for, I definitely suggest you buy it.\n","905: Very affordable but I regret the purchase just was a bit flimsy. Would be awesome for a little teen. Overall its cute. Probably wont last or for certain will get lost in a pocket never to be seen again....\n","906: Arrived on time. I'm a RealTree Girl & I love jewelry so this is the best of both. Pendant is a very nice size. The neon green is unique. The cord is sturdy. I think I'm going to buy the blue one, too. Definitely recommend.\n","907: THE BEST HEADBANDS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. I have already ordered them twice. They last SO long and I get compliments on them every single time I wear them. I've worn them to workout, to swim, to spray tan, and everyday wear!! They hold up for so long. I will continue to re order\n","908: The hat is quality, but it looks like a typical baseball cap when it is put on. ! was expecting something a it more classy for the money.\n","909: It looked cute online, but was terribly unflattering. Runs small. Returned.\n","910: It is ok.\n","911: These sandals work quite well for relieving the pain of Diabetic Neuropathy and Arthritis.  They are comfortable to wear, although not made for walking in.  The conductive probes relay good stimulation from the TENS unit with the use of conductive gel or spray, and the pain relief lasted for several days in my case.  There was strong stimulation of the calf muscles in both legs which resulted in a complete cessation of night time leg cramps.  I have heavy scaring and calluses on one foot, but the multiple conductive probes of the sandals were able to work around this problem.  I highly recommend these sandals if you suffer from Neuropathy in your feet, or Arthritic pain in your toes or ankles.  Blessed relief!\n","912: Warm and comfortable!!\n","913: Fits perfectly, a great cross between professional or casual and very comfortable without being too clingy.\n","914: returning. Too big, one size down too small ..this one has a huge elastic twist there's no fixing except  paying for alterations. Amazon needs to stop this 3rdparty cheap app junk.  Disgusted.  Measurements didn't match at all either\n","915: Excellent watch. Handsome and extremely accurate. It looks more expensive than it appears to be.\n","916: Sturdy wallet, but with just a few cars it is quite thick.<br /><br />Wallet should come with money so we know what it looks like inside the wallet and how to keep bills sorted.\n","917: Pretty outfit\n","918: Easily dresses up or down. I wore it with a blue buttonless long sleeve sweater. It was a fun look tying the corners of the sweater up around my waist, but wore sweater down for a casual evening look.\n","919: Easily organizes everything, expedites transactions as everything is visible and easy access. Love it!\n","920: She loved it.\n","921: See through tight and uneven in some areas not a nice product\n","922: Very cute swing dress but no cotton blend, it's polyester.  I love the shade of deep green, it's very flattering.  I prefer to wear with leggings.\n","923: The sleeves are too tight on my arms and I was expecting a cotton blend fabric.  It's polyester and not stretchy or breathable.  It's super cute otherwise  so apple shapes with thin arms will love it.\n","924: These are better than under armour highly recommend former under armour wearer best value also.\n","925: The hat came with the brim wire broken. It was floppier than I expected, so I returned it. The flower detail was cute.\n","926: Cheaply made, but lovely design. The first one I revived had bubbles obscuring the text, but I was promptly sent a new one. Great customer service!\n","927: I sent it back just because its brim was too wide for me; even with the front folded up, there was just too much brim. Otherwise a good quality sun hat.\n","928: Just what I needed for a trip when I didn't want to take my big purse but needed to carry credit cards, driver's license, other ID, + my reading glasses. Great quality and stayed pretty flat even with the glasses in it. I'd buy it again.\n","929: This looks nothing like the picture. I should say the fit is nothing like the picture. Decent quality sweater but HUGE and not cropped or baggy in the cute oversized look sort of way just wide and sloppy looking.. sent back.\n","930: Stiff, stitching nothing like the photo and overall just kinds cheap looking..\n","931: Not as cute in person.. The color was a bit dingy looking and more old fashioned looking than trendy. Material was decent and not see thru. I sent it back but I suppose if it was worn with the right shoes and accessorized it could be cute. I just found it a bit too boxy and overall not as cute or flattering as pictured. I ordered a small and it was a bit big but fit fine I am about 5'5 and 128lbs.\n","932: I am 5'6 and around 126 lbs and (almost) always wear a small in dresses, esp flowy/loose style ones. So I got a small in this and it was too tight across the shoulders and bust (I am 34-36 small C). Nice material and color though :) Sending back for medium. Love the neck! And versatility  to be dressy or casual.\n","933: Super cute, nice quality material and not see thru or sheer like many comparably priced (t-shirt type) dresses. My only complaint is the pockets, most seem to like them I think they are annoying and the only unflattering part of this somewhat form fitting therefore flattering dress. I like how this dress is loose yet has a bit of a shape and not so &#34;box like&#34; or &#34;maternity&#34; looking. I am almost 5'6 and weight around 130 maybe just under and a small is perfect.. it's also a lot longer than the picture almost too long for my personal preference but not quite.\n","934: I was not sure if this would stand up like the ridge.  I can say it has and meet every expectation. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great front pocket compact wallet.\n","935: Great pants..... Keeps the wind off your legs, plenty of pockets, awesome product would buy again. Idk how quick they'd dry because it has some cotton in them but it's a small amount anyways so it should dry fairly quick.\n","936: Love this nose ring.  The bendable aspect makes it perfect.\n","937: I thought it might be too small but took a chance.  It's fun, well made and soft.  Just not large enough for my huge melon!\n","938: Smokin' deal!  Got a few to hand out to homeless this October.\n","939: Very cute for the price\n","940: Bought it for my buddy. Loves it. Very colorful.  Dancing at the grill!\n","941: Look nice for the price but very very small.\n","942: Wrong size does not stretch much either.\n","943: Love them!!!!\n","944: I love these shoes, I bought them in 3 colors. they are very comfortable, and true to size.\n","945: ADORABLE....🥰. Fits perfectly. Pants size 3 & small top size & I got an XS & it fit great.\n","946: Very expensive...Beautiful card though but got a generic envelope...not the one pictured in advertisement.\n","947: Great fit, great value. The case was exactly the right size for a pair of prescription Ray Ban glasses. When it arrived, it had some sort of glue on the case--looked like perhaps the glue used to attach the liner seeped out onto the case a bit. I was able to remove it, gently, with a cloth and warm water.\n","948: Coarse material. Barely got over my head.\n","949: Love it.\n","950: Really cute necklace, just right\n","951: Husband loved them, warm and toasty\n","952: It’s $30 for an amazing dupe. Get it now before it’s gone.\n","953: I bought this as a birthday gift for my grandson and he absolutely loved it. Useful and great value for the money.\n","954: I love these socks. The  color is perfect, comfortable, and I love the quantity.\n","955: These are sized small. Definitely step into these when trying on. EDIT: Customer service contacted me regarding my return of this item. They are very helpful and concerned with any problem you have and willing to send a replacement. Unfortunately they do not offer an xl size. The garment itself seems to be well made for the thin frame. CS contacted me a second time with another style in an xl size. I received it today and I am very pleased.\n","956: I have lots of hair and its waaay too large\n","957: Its an attractive and well made shirt. Has a slenderizing effect\n","958: Shoe laces have no extra length to be trimmed to the proper size and then put the metal cover on. Even if I could trim them the screw and screwdriver they send with the laces don’t really match up well and it’s nearly impossible to see what you’re doing anyway even if the screwdriver wasn’t slightly too big for the screw. It’s a good idea. Not executed well at all.\n","959: does exactly what it should. goes to the knees. will buy again.\n","960: I love these!  They are a perfect fit and the waist is so comfortable, not tight like some.  And I love the soft material.  Very pleased!  Thank you!\n","961: The best sports bra I’ve had and a great deal. Had to size up but that’s fine! Buy these bras- they are amazing!!\n","962: Love this bag and fits everything I need for the gym. Thank you!\n","963: Too tight. I am 5'1, 114lbs 29in waist.<br />Too tight. Too tight, too tight.<br /><br />Very odd fit. Have to wear the waist way up high for the length to be correct.<br /><br />Material is strange, not lined.<br /><br />I try them on and put them back and try them again. I dont think i can wear these\n","964: I bought it large. It is comfortable. The fabric is so soft.\n","965: Good quality metal and looks really cool when wearing them in both my nostril piercings\n","966: Super cute shirt and nice quality, I did buy a 3XL (I'm a size 16) and it fits perfectly. The fit is a little loose, exactly the way I like it. If you like a tighter fit, you might be fine with 2XL.\n","967: They have more universal sizes and the XL should cover up to 40C. The cups don't have the capacity to hold that kind of size, but the bra itself is really nice and if you are a smaller cup size, it will look super cute.\n","968: I'm so disappointed in the bra, it is way too small. I'm usually between a 36 and 38, but went ahead and ordered the larger size, since items from china tent to run a bit snug. The cups are not made to hold a C cup and the straps are not adjustable, since I do have a longer torso, the straps are digging in and the bra is not where it is supposed to be. I had to return it.\n","969: The bra itself was gorgous, the band was wide and comfortable, but even though I ordered a C cup (I'm a B), the cups were way to small and didn't look flattering at all.\n","970: Did not work for me, even though it says A/B and I'm a B, this is more for a very small A size. Bummer, the look was really nice.\n","971: I work this dress to work yesterday and felt like I could wear it into the evening.  It is so comfortable and hangs nicely.  I received so many compliments.  The weight of the material is just right.\n","972: Fun way to wear owls.\n","973: Wash before you wear it. It did stain my pillow case. I had to tighten it a bit. It was a bit large. Good buy for the price. Material is inexpensive. I don’t think it will last the year.  Fit my braids, stayed on through the night. Comfortable.\n","974: Fit well. I’m 5’3” 180lbs I purchased a large. I had to return it because the sequence was catching onto everything. I was afraid of damaging dress so I chose to return it.\n","975: Loved the dress from day one. I’m 5’3” 185 it fit perfectly! I hadn’t been out in soo long and I danced the night away in full comfort. The dress is beautiful! And for the price you can’t beat it!\n","976: Purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend.  She didn't kill me for them, so I guess they worked.\n","977: Purchased these as a gift for my girlfriend.  She didn't kill me for them, so I guess they worked.\n","978: I bought these as a gift for a friend.  They love them, saying that they fit fine and are quite comfortable.  That's about all I can say\n","979: Very nice comforting fit.\n","980: Fits just as I expected it to fit, one more thing I love about Alfred Dunner clothing.\n","981: At 4.99 for the pair and $4.99 for shipping and handling, the hats average out to under five bucks each.<br /><br />I bought several inexpensive beanie hats from different vendors through Amazon and the four that I've received so far from the Florida Hat Company and Hair Coverings are all very good.  They have a nice tight weave, so they are not slouchy beanies; they're beanies that look presentable.  They are all nice, bright colors.  Without any stretching, they each have a circumference of approximately 14 inches, which you can of course stretch to fit a normal size head.<br /><br />I'm a small female who lives in New York and similar type hats have been my hat of choice for years.  Each of the hats that I describe below have a good weave that is adequate enough to keep me warm in temperatures below fifty degrees; I don't find them suffocating hot in moderate temperatures and they keep me comfortable in thirty degree weather.  I'm not foolish enough to stay out too long in temperatures lower than that; my lower earlobes may get a bit cold, but it's not bad.<br /><br />From Hair Coverings, I bought two hats that were labeled royal blue, but in truth one is closer to teal in color and is more inexpensive.  The royal blue is the best of the four hats in terms of the quality of the acrylic yarn and the weave.  It has no pills.  The length is 12 ¾ inches.  The teal hat is also good, but the quality of the yarn isn't as flawless as the royal blue; it's a little pilly, since the thread looks a bit uneven.  It's still a good hat, however.  Its length is 11 ½ inches.<br /><br />From the Florida Hat Co., I received the described hunter's orange hats that come as a pair.  These have a slightly looser weave, but it's so minor that it's barely noticeable.  The yarn is good, no pills.  Its length is 11 ½ inches.<br /><br />If anyone reading this is from the Highridge area of Yonkers and is familiar with the 99 cent store near Pathmark that sold similar beanies, you'll have a better reference as to the quality of these hats.  Each of the hats I bought on-line are within the four to five dollar range; I purposely chose those low prices because I was looking for a hat that's similar to the hats I used to purchase in Yonkers, which had a nice weave, weren't too hot, and have held up well in the wash for years.  Well, the on-line hats meet all those qualities and are a bit larger with a slightly tighter weave.  For me, they're excellent, and I'm glad that I was able to find pretty, bright colors that offer some degree of visibility when I'm crossing the street.\n","982: I'm going to return them. I ordered the size I wear in everything and even on my right foot (the slightly bigger one), I was swimming in them.\n","983: I wanted a pair of earrings that would look nice for day or evening and that I could sleep in as well. These are exactly what I was looking for. I like them a lot. They are very pretty, very sparkly, and still comfy if I lay down in them.\n","984: I wanted to love this. But it was way to small.  But two sizes up.\n","985: I love this shirt. My student's thought it was funny and I was able to use it as part of my lesson that day. Sadly, I did have to explain it to a couple of grown-ups when I wore it to a party. It is SLIGHTLY smaller than true size so buy one size up to be safe.\n","986: It fit as expected, and it held up well in the wash.\n","987: Love the sparkles, color and flower design. Lots of compliments so I shared with many others at work.\n","988: It is very thin and small than I expected. Other than that it is a fine piece.\n","989: Silver jewelry goes attractively with any style or color as a tasteful fashion accessory.\n","990: Very cute on and a wonderful price point. You can dress this down or to go out at night. Very pretty and good quality.\n","991: Fits true to size and I wear it with leather pants and it looks great. Dress up or down.\n","992: Great product-easy-nice packaging\n","993: True to size, very well made.  Cute and warm. Nice packaging- ready for gift giving.  Color is true to website pics. Soft leather and cozy inside!\n","994: Took forever to arrive (but I knew that before purchasing) Worth the wait though. It is lovely. And it is very hard to find a zip up jacket like this with no collar.  The embroidery is nice as well. And the color is pretty.\n","995: PROS:<br />It functions as expected. The venting is great and at least on the black version, blends well.<br />I have a 22&#34; head. It is ALMOST too tight. But works.<br />The top of the hat is deep. So I can pull it down much further than in the photos. Fully over my eyebrows if I wanted.But it is tight enough that if I perch it higher it doesn't slip. (the bow in the back allows for further tightening).<br />CONS:<br />However the material feels more like nylon than polyester and thus makes a TON of noise every time you move your head and the back rubs against your shoulders. And the way it is shaped it cups your ears, funneling that &#34;fwip fwip&#34; noise right in at full volume.<br />If you use the ponytail hole it increases the noisy because it weighs down the back.<br />It also fights with the bow. You want the bow over the ponytail I think, but either way, the bow has to get distorted over or under the ponytail.\n","996: I love these. I have several styles including this one (Same brand, same material) and they all are wonderful. They are soft, they are not scratchy. They fit plus sizes very well. Size 20-26 for sure. But I suspect a8-28 is the full range. Smaller than that and it would be a little loose. It may fit bigger.<br />They stay up well and don't run easily (I have not yet managed to make them run) Note that these are a thicker material. Not super thin like most tights.\n","997: It was an anonymous Christmas gift for a child. I thought it was good because it was a good weight and adjustable.\n","998: Very nice rocks. Smooth and several were nice and large in size. Daughter is happy with them. Paint pens work well to decorate them. Perfect craft for fighting the COVID19.\n","999: Comfy and pretty. I had a dble mastectomy with reconstruction and although the plus size fits me around, it does not cover my breasts fully. Might have to wait to wear until healing is complete. I am only a C so bummed that the bigger size didn't fit. Very pretty tho.\n"]}],"source":["for i in range(1000):\n","    print(f'{i}: {df[\"text\"].to_list()[i]}')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/tmp/ipykernel_10032/3032416594.py:2: MarkupResemblesLocatorWarning: The input looks more like a filename than markup.
