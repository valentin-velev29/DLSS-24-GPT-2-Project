The problem with these reviews is that they are not helpful. They do not provide any information about the product that would be useful to potential buyers.

In this blog post, we'll explore the concept of trust in reviews and how it can be affected by things like the reviewer's identity, the review's content, and the product's popularity.
The first thing to consider when thinking about trust in reviews is the identity of the reviewer. If the reviewer is a well-known and trusted source, then their review is likely to be more trustworthy than a review from a random person.
