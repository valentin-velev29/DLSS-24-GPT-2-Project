It's like a soft, stretchy fleece-type T-shirt, so it's not see through. I just wish it came in a bigger size, so I don't bother trying it on. As an XL, I got the Medium and it fit great. I'll definitely order from this company again.UPDATE: the shirt was clearly mis-able, but I washed it with a few wrinkles and the seam that appeared like the first time. When I wore this shirt in the first place, I noticed all the threads and the bottom was already tearing. I'm not sure how a seamstress will fix it, because the fabric is a little rough. It's a bit too stiff, but it's also quite thin so it's not quite as thick. It\nIndividual Perplexity: 9.56\nMean Perplexity across all reviews: 12.97\n\nReview 599: I was wrong.

This color just wasn't the bright pink I expected (blue green and dark grey), but it's the color of the vest that I received! I ordered the tan/grey color. It does fit well around the neck, and it did not feel cheap looking or chunky like it was stiff at all. The fabric was soft (it was stiff and thick, the stitching was stiff, not easily seen).

The first picture, it was made of thin material, and not something to stay away from the shirt was on my husband.I'm glad I want to keep it so I've been happy with a similar hoodie (or that isn't low end of this shirt look cool. I also note that I've been pretty cool but I've gotten excited because it looks so awesome and maybe even if I've bought an XL or if I'll keep it.In the light was cute and it are still be decent if you are if you are better with it.

The quality of it's not great. It took a while riding, so, even without a bra. It's a complete piece, in some way, so, I only wear it to play. I've probably made better. The color is pretty but I'm not a true story. I ordered two, though. I think that's a nice looking black but it's not an off-or maybe for that's supposed to be expected.\nPerplexity: 21.09\nMean Perplexity: 21.67\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPrompt: I purchased this T-shirt on Amazon recently. Here's my experience so far.\nIndex: 583\nReview: It's perfect in the world! The color is a lovely deep green, the fabric is very soft, so there's nothing wrong about it. The fit on me is perfect. I ordered an XL and I'm 5'8. I love the color and the feel of the material. I will order again in another color.\nPerplexity: 9.30\nMean Perplexity: 12.97\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIndex: 553\nReview: This is very good quality, thin, warm, cool, & has pockets, so, it really suits your body well.

It's comfortable and stylish.\nPerplexity: 19.43\nMean Perplexity: 12.97\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIndex: 570\nReview: The color is slightly different from the pictures that posted. I purchased the Black, green, purple, and it is a solid wine red. The taupe is a great length for me because it is not so long. The fit is snug and the chiffon material is not thin. It will be good for cool winter.\nPerplexity: 16.23\nMean Perplexity: 12.97\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIndex: 545\nReview: It's a great weight top. It has a soft material, without being uncomfortable or too thin. It's a great length, though. If you're looking for a cute, loose fitting, functional, thick, stretchy, wide enough to wear. I wouldn't wear this in public, but I still love this top.\nPerplexity: 13.95\nMean Perplexity: 12.97\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIndex: 544\nReview: I was a little surprised as I was getting a great deal. As I wanted it to be a long sleeve t-shirt, the cut is really short and unflattering. I usually wear a large. I bought a small which I normally wear, which was too big because I like loose fitting t-shirts to wear in public. The large is actually very short in the stomach and too loose on my arms (I'm 5'5\" with skinny legs and a short torso). The arms are still tight on my torso so I didn't even bother with the sleeves being too tight, had to return and pay for a refund. So, I decided a medium and size XL. The medium would have fit me perfectly. I recommend sizing up 1 or 2 sizes. I would say a large would've been a nice medium. However the large would probably fit better. It is just okay.\nPerplexity: 10.81\nMean Perplexity: 12.97\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIndex: 539\nReview: I found that the sweater has goodged up sleeves but in a way that's what it is, the only reason I ordered this one because it's cheap but I'll keep it.

I am keeping the product because it fits me perfectly, although it's a little longer than the measurements provided. The XL is really tight in the chest, and the sleeves in the stomach/p area aren't stretchy enough to be tucked in. The large fit me fine but the arms are a bit short. I will order in other colors.\nPerplexity: 11.19\nMean Perplexity: 12.97\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nIndex: 510\nReview: I have a few items to wear on a hot summer day.

I've been wanting something cute to pull over my pants and t-shirt to give me some extra support, so I bought a larger size. This is perfect for layering with a bra and blazer in both front pocket and the back. Love this style and love it.I've never had to go back to wearing it, and again. I've got many compliments on this shirt, many complements and this shirt is of very good quality.   \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The fit, color, the style. What I got was a great fit and a cute shirt. It was very wide and very wide. I wear a 14/16 for a woman, I got this for my 11 yr old sister who typically wears 12. She wears a 13 and I got the xxl, which is what I would normally wear. If you're on the smaller side then, you should have to try the next size up.   \n2     The picture is misleading. It's not a highlighter, but it's a more high-quality. There are no tag inside it, and it is a heavy knit. It is a cheap thin T-shirt. It's cheap material so it feels like the shirt was made for someone with a very weak necked body. You'll probably need to purchase a girdle skirt or something this probably won't work for you. It does run big, and I purchased an XS. The XL was so big and I can't even button the buttons because they are a little tight on me.The seams at the neckline looked terrible and the button holes were poorly sewn. If the collar hadn't been sewn on, I would have had to pay to ship it back. I am not going to give it 2 stars for the quality. I'm super disappointed and since it is a beautiful shirt, it's a good quality product.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      First one fits and looks great on.

I ordered it in a large which usually runs small. Normally I wear a large, so I ordered a Large and it was quite tight. I had to return it. The fit was perfect, the material seemed nice and the neckline was a bit snug. It felt comfortable, but maybe a medium would have been better.

This was not a good quality product at all. It's super thin and you can see EVERYTHING. The fit was fine but the material of the sweater was very thin so the sizing wasn't accurate.   \n9997                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In my opinion, I didn't have time to return it to my surprise of the disappointment. It was very comfortable and washes up nicely and does the job. I wore this to the office and was very happy with the workmanship and fit and support of the coat. This will be the only positive I have found that I will probably not get to wear the shirt.   \n9998                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I ended up giving it to my 12 year old granddaughter, but the tag said that it had a hole in the seam right out of the sleeve, which looks like someone tried to pull it down. I'm glad I had really high hopes. Then, the jacket ripped at the bottom seam. So I was disappointed.   \n9999                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               It washes beautifully in the wash and dries perfectly.

It is a cheap thin T-shirt. It's cheap material so it feels like the shirt was made for someone with a very weak necked body. You'll probably need to purchase a girdle skirt or something this probably won't work for you. It does run big, and I purchased an XS. The XL was so big and I can't even button the buttons because they are a little tight on me.The seams at the neckline looked terrible and the button holes were poorly sewn. If the collar hadn't been sewn on, I would have had to pay to ship it back. I am not going to give it 2 stars for the quality.

There are seams hanging out all over the place where they should be sewn on, and the sleeves are sewn in an odd shape. The sleeves aren't even sewn on well, and the quality is lacking.

It's great to hang around but it's a good sleeve length which does not stay in place. Would definitely buy more of these. Highly recommend for the office!I would recommend. I'll give it 5 stars as it's adorable.   \n4742  We are the RIPPING. We bought this for our 2 year old to go back to school. I wanted it to be more loose, but not so much. The material is very thin and not soft and very thin, although a 2 year old's bathrobe is very soft on one end, he has to tuck the lanyard on. We have a feeling this top would be helpful for a child to wear when he starts his arms, which I was not happy. It doesn't keep my son warm for longer than some, especially since the fabric was thin and he just kept cold weather all day, and it was very warm. I recommend this seller.   \n4521                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The shirt is absolutely adorable. It's not too much of a cosplay shirt, but it's a great quality and fits great. I wish I could choose from these companies. They are a great buy. The quality is really great.

It's not as warm as I hoped. It does not take any getting in, however, I have very sensitive skin and I love the material. I had hoped for a better product based on reviews, but I was concerned about the fit or sizing. I went ahead and ordered a XL. (I normally wear L or M/XL) and it fit perfect.

It was not small at all... I'm a size 8-12. I ordered the size Medium because I wanted to have a snug fit. Unfortunately I ended up returning it because I loved the color! It's not really a bad shirt.
