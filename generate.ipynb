But I got the package today and the shirt in the mail mail yesterday is as if the shirt was made in the USA!  I took a picture of my hanging bits next to mine but the shirt is VERY different from what is pictured here.  The colors are much brighter and the pattern looks very dull and cheap. I would have done better shopping at Walmart for a better quality shirt, not here.  Not to mention the sizes are not consistent, they seem like they are smaller than US XL.  I wear a medium, and that's what I ordered.  I would give it a 4 but it's not worth my time or money and I won't be keeping it.  I will never order from the USA again!\n",
