817584,"I like the design a lot, but by the time it arrived, the weather here was too cold to wear it. So, I'll have it for next spring.[[ASIN:B01N2L2Y0A Meaneor Women's High Low Loose Long Blouse Casual T-shirt Top Black XL]]"
524385,"Another polyester shirt, pic looks like a tshirt type material."
1935551,"I am 5'3"" and the small is at my upper thigh in length. It needs to be listed as a t-shirt not a dress."
1420875,"T-shirt was fine, skirt was much too big; still adorable"
1634360,"Like the looks, have not worn it yet."
494986,Way smaller and cheaper looking than expected. Colors aren’t as rich looking. It looks more like a faded T-shirt. Not true to size. I even ordered up a size and it’s still too small. I’m currently a size 6.
1042728,"great t-shirt, comfortable. I ordered a men's medium for my 15 year old, fits perfect. He got a kick out of it because he loves bacon."
896955,"Wouldn't recommend buying this if you're looking for a sweatshirt. Really thin material. Not a sweatshirt, more like a long sleeve t-shirt."
1082738,Fabric is like tshirt material. Very thin. Kind of wanted sweatshirt style jacket.
731502,"It looks cute on me and I like the high waist part, somehow hiding my fat waist 233333. But it runs large. I usually wear large or 10-12 for tshirt/shirt/tank/one-piece dress and 8 for pant. I bought a large first and it runs super big. Then I changed to a medium and it's still a little big but not that bad. And since I don't have time to place another order before Ieft for my vacation, I just took the mid one."
159763,"This was a great present for my dad. It gave us all a good laugh, he wears it all the time, and it's a quality t-shirt. Love it!"
221037,Super thin not tshirt material as it looks in pic
574126,"This is NOT a sweatshirt... it is thin tshirt material designed as a sweatshirt! Purchased a 13-14y for my 8 year grandson (2nd grade) that weighs all of 72 lbs and wears size 12. He will be able to wear this shirt for only this season. Looks good in the picture (nice graphics) but it is poor quality. I do believe the fabric will bead after one or two washes. Also, the hood does not have a string. Very disappointed. Definitely not worth $20"
900188,"I would definitely recommend ordering a size down. I originally ordered this shirt for my boyfriend in a xl, however when it arrived we discovered that it fit more like an XXL. We ended up swapping shirts with one another and I wore it as an oversized t-shirt. The style was just as it appears on photos."
219817,"I ordered these for my granddaughters. They are nothing like the picture. They are very cheap material and workmanship. The ruffle on the bottom is not strips of material sewed together as shown, rather a printed t-shirt material sewed to the bottom. This is false advertisement. Don't waste your money. I was so disappointed when they arrived."
2020773,The image on the t-shirt is is off-center…. way to the left. Now it’s a shirt I just sleep in- bought another one (in blue) hoping it would be ok — and it was!
812135,"Fabric is soft and drapes nicely. So great to wear what is essentially a t-shirt but looks great as a dress. A go-to staple in y wardrobe. I am a petite size, so it comes down to my ankles, but does not require altering the hem for me."
552653,Its ok but not a sweater. Tshirt material
1711838,This was a total disappointment. I got the XL/18 size because I wanted it to be extra roomy (like in the picture) and it fits light a tight t-shirt. The length is also completely misrepresented and this is more of a shirt than a tunic. Definitely sized way small and not for tall people in the slightest.
762220,"Decent quality but a bit more fitted than I would like. Size up if you want to layer t-shirt underneath. The color and pattern is rather muted, much less vibrant than the photo enhanced picture. Returned and went with another brand."
1958356,"It's great unfortunately it doesn't have the band line-up on the back or choice of color but I like yellow so ""It's Casual."""
1010649,"A VERRRY shiny material. You can see every bump, wrinkle, lace, roll, whatever you got going on under it..youll see it. The black is ok, but youll HAVE to wear a tshirt bra underneath. I got the pink one too and i wont ever wear it.The lace up doesnt come down that far either :("
1343347,"This is the fourth time i wear this t-shirt, inside the house, never washed. Today i noticed the print is coming out. Such a really bad quality print. Never happened this to me with any other t-shirt. I will not recommend to anybody to buy this one. I have the pictures but for some reasons i don't know i can't post them."
607230,"This tunic looks great with white capris. Comfy. Only thing is after one wear I can see snags or little fuzz balls like a sweater gets, on chest area from necklace I was wearing. Material is stretchy like a T-shirt, pretty delicate."
674237,"Not t-shirt material, and way too small for the size it was supposed to be."
2189649,Absolutely the comfyiest Tshirt
1268851,"Perfect fit! Just Beautiful! Looks just like the picture! I'm 5'4.5 and 138 lbs athletic build 34ccc-29-36. I purchased the gray, in a small. It just barely touches the floor which I like so when I put heels on it won't be too short. It's a smooth stretchy t-shirt material. The dress can be worn inside out for a finished ""seamless"" look. I'm very pleased with this purchase and would purchase it again!"
1942804,"Love this t shirt so much I bought tow colours.Feels so soft. Stretchy, good quality looks great. Best T-shirt’s I have bought this year!"
637493,Very happy with my t-shirt. Fit was accurate!
442167,The dress arrived on time and fits a little big but I like it.
1592079,"You pay what you get for , cheap cheap cheap , the pocket fell off already !! Lol the material is very light almost like an under armor tshirt and the sizing is very small , incredibly small"
621941,"I don't know why I expected magic from this technology, but it didn't happen. In the end it's an OK t-shirt, nothing too custom tailored or extra flattering about it."
1155981,"Although the set looked nice, the applique wasn't sewn on well, and was peeling up off the t-shirt. Buy this one with caution."
1486618,"This is a slinky material, not a regular t-shirt material."
380018,I ordered the teal on 5/13 and it arrived via US mail 5/20 (wow). It is really cute. I ordered a M/L and I am a normal size 12. Honestly I could have ordered a small. The garment is really big but because the fabric is really soft (think we’ll worn T-shirt) it hangs cute. I think one size fits all is probably more accurate on the sizing. For the price (I paid $10.99 total including shipping) this is perfect. I am very pleased.
324073,"The ""t-shirt"" is literally see-through... not high quality at all."
1120019,"THIN!!! The product arrived after 3 days and looks just as pictured. My only complaint is that it’s thin like a long sleeved shirt. No it’s not a thin T-shirt, it’s a good weight T-shirt. But it’s advertised as a sweater... It is NOT a sweater. I wouldn’t pay 30$ for this T-shirt in person, so I may send it backUpdate: I decided to keep it. After washing it the first time, it shrunk in the dryer. I’m mad I didn’t return it"
1936012,I like how the Tshirt fits and I like that fabric it's made from. I am a mustang enthusiast - gonna have to get another one.
1414998,Very good and breathable material. I ordered the orange tshirt which looks very good. Perfect for gym.
91268,Was a nice tshirt
522154,"I ordered the extra large because I am plus sized. I wear a 2X in tops and 18/20 in pants. A little bit top heavy, so I wanted to make sure I could button the buttons over my boobs. If you are a plus sized man or woman, the XL onesie will fit you perfectly.I do believe however, if you are 300 or more pounds it might not fit as well, or at all.That's why I gave you my sizes. The fit is very good.I am 5""3 tall, so the legs of the onesie go right down to my ankles.The ankles on the onesie are elasticized.The legs are not as baggy as the rest of the onesie.So it's kind of funny. it looks like you have these little stick legs, and from your hips up everything is so big and baggy..lol You can either Unbutton it to use the bathroom, or use the zipper in the back. I tried the zipper method. it's quick and easy, and you are given enough room, to do what you have to do.The body part of the onesie is quite large and baggy.The only thing I noticed is there is a little bit of gapping in between each button. I usually wear a T-shirt or tank top underneath my onesie, so I just leave it unbuttoned on the top.But if I wanted to wear it out as a costume, I would have to pin on the inside to eliminate the gapping. The arms are comfortable. They were not tight or constricting. The hood/head part is what really makes the costume cute. I absolutely love the yellow unicorn Horn, the eyes, etc. that's the part that attracts all of the attention. Also the tail is cute too LOL If I fall asleep in it I do wake up quite warm in the middle of the night. It seems kind of thin, but when you are under the blankets, you do remain warm.I also love to wear it after I am home. I am settling in for the night, I get on my computer, Blog, etc. it's perfect. The price was 29.99 . I was looking at a few other styles on Amazon. There is one popular brand of onesies that start at $60 each.So not only did I save 30+ dollars, I received this in two days, and everything about it is pretty much perfect and what I wanted it to be .PS I chose the blue unicorn style"
2002595,T-shirt was huge and logo was low quality- looked pixelated and was scratchy and hard. Returning and you have to pay a return shipping fee.
1220132,"Cute - just not flattering on me. T-shirt weight, soft knit fabric. Not see-through."
1958221,I prefer more of a stretchier type material in a t-shirt like most that are made today. I found this shirt to be uncomfortable and it didn’t fit me like most shirts do.
365444,Product description showed as sweatshirt but is t-shirt material. The lettering is very poor quality.
466460,T-shirt material. This is a decorative or summer/spring item. Very dramatic!
2065921,Love my t-shirt! I got a lot of compliments on the shirt and would recommend it to a friend.
302154,"I thought these were the ones I ordered before. The ones I got before were more like tshirt materal, these are stiffer and scratchy. I washed them didn't help and they don't fit the same as the other 5 pair I got I likesorry"
101402,I got lots of compliments on the shirt!
584884,"Such a cheap looking tshirt! Returned! Decal is shiny, not at all like photos. The material is almost slick feeling & the tacked sleeves I don’t like."
1831631,"Exactly what I was looking for. Medium compression for under workout t-shirt but not too constricting, making it comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Washes well also! Order a size smaller than you normally would. I'm a XL/XXL generally and I ordered the US Large and it fits perfectly."
551088,Son loves this shirt
1628892,"I went on a t-shirt buying binge, purchasing about 15 of them in a single day. Once my shirts arrived, I wore a new one every day and posted pics on my Instagram page. Of all the ""cool"" shirts I posted, this one got the most love. R.I.P. MCA"
613412,This runs very small. Very thin t-shirt material. Shrinks a lot.
87923,The shirt I expected was an oversized off the shoulder adorable shirt. After reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes big and it's still very snug the kneck hole is like a t-shirt not wide at all and it's 3/4 sleeve. I will say the material is soft and comfortable and it is wearable. BUT it isn't what I wanted.
710772,Love the T-shirt and the prompt receipt of the T-shirt. Thanks
259853,"If you're a smaller person, you won't be able to fit this dress. It is extremely baggy and looks more like an oversized men's t-shirt. The material is very thin in a flimsy and cheap way, not a breathable and nice way. The splashes of color are more gauche than stylish and the overall quality of the dress is lacking. Returning."
1484399,"When I opened the package and pulled out this shirt, my jaw dropped. I ordered an XL. The tag says XL, but it looks like it was made for a little girl it's so tiny. The material is not a thermal knit, it's a very cheap tshirt material. This was a huge disappointment and will be sent back."
1164211,"Got these for my daughter for her birthday. She LOVES them!! They fit well, are soft, and seem to be well made. The shirt is cute enough she said she may just wear it as a regular t-shirt!"
2048593,"I am now into my 2nd summer of this swimsuit and it has held up nicely. Just a little wear since I live close to the beach and have gotten lots of use out of it. This swimsuit is fashionably modest and so comfortable, that it feels like a nice t-shirt. I don't have to worry about any strings or keeping the top in place. The swimsuit was true to size. I have just placed an order for another one. If you are looking for an adorable swimsuit, look no further!"
1561266,Definately worth the buy. Fabric is nice and soft. Fits as expected. I bought medium so I could tie/knot bottom of tshirt
1570701,The fabric is not as bad as the confection the pants were big issue the T-shirt’s were fine
1783134,This is NOT a winter hat! is wrong! DO NOT BUY! Made from t-shirt material
259434,This romper runs small. I’m a size 14-16 pants and large T-shirt. I ordered the 2xl. It doesn’t stretch. My arms and chest could barely fit it. I do have larger arms and breasts (38G). If you’re top heavy I suggest ordering a size up.
724141,Material is thin and size is not true. Feels as if I'm wearing a large or at best a XL but NOT 2X as ordered. I've found usually the cheap close run small. $29 for t-shirt didn't seem too cheap to me.
1461798,"This is a nice graphic tshirt, the part ""BEAST"" and drawing are very well printed. However, first time you wear this shirt you notice that the tissue, cotton is the worst quality possible. I bought recently a T-shirt for 4 $ which has a better building quality than this one. I went on a brief walk with this and seemed like a punishment. If only they have imported a better tissue, this could've been a nice shirt"
2010419,"I used this product, and it was okay. Not the quality I was expecting, and it wasn't the size I was expecting. However, it did allow me to get the job done."
30958,"Xl is not an xl it fits like a small, no stretch to it, it fit like a tshirt. Scratchy material. Do not recommend"
684896,"While I like this tshirt now, it took a bit of effort. I don't know if it was too much starch in the material, but this shirt was very odd-feeling, bordering on scratchy, when I received it. Took quite a bit of soaking in a salt/vinegar/baking soda solution, then washing it and drying it to get the material even close to being soft."
261249,Awesome t shirt stretchy antic that compresses where needed but light weight. Perfect for work outs
374026,"Everyone should try ""custom t-shirt"" its amazing you can send them a picture and get the results you do.This is the first long sleeve one I have ordered, I wish the sleeves were a little bit longer but I am happy with the results!!!"
989281,This jacket is super cute with all the embroidery. It isn't lined (which you can tell by the pictures) but it's perfect to wear over a dress or outfit on a cool day and it has lots of colors in it to go with lots of outfits. I got a 4/5 for my daughter but this is definitely a 4. It was too small for her to put on by herself and she can still wear a size 4 in a t-shirt. Definitely size up if you are purchasing.
863957,I don't even want to give this one star. I purchased this for myself in XXL and I referred to the sizing chart for US sizes as I am a size 20-24 depending on the style I can wear 18-20 top and 20-22 bottom. This is clearly misadvertisement as the description states sweater dress but it is actually the material of an underwear style t-shirt that you get in a 5 pack at Walmart. I ultimately didn't want to go through the hassle so I lost money and let my daughter use it as a nightgown but we could've really used it as a pillow because that's how thin and small it was.
1813981,My boyfriend LOVED this shirt! Perfect for a subaru enthusiast! He always gets compliments on it when he wears it :)
1006010,"The picture makes the dress appear to be a shiny fabric, but it is just a flat knit like a t-shirt."
87300,"Cute spin on a standard t-shirt dress. I love that it's just knit and easy to care for, but has the cute cold shoulder detail. It's a brighter red than I normally wear, but have already worn it more than anticipated because it's so cute and comfortable. It's a great dress to wear to work with a sweater or cardigan, but then dressy enough to go out in after work. Would recommend, and would buy again.5'1, 110lbs, ordered small and it fits great!"
943215,"SUPER CUTE graphic on a well made t-shirt. I typically wear a xl but ordered a 2xl because I like my t-shirts loose fitting and it fit great, I highly recommend."
1231006,The fabric is a little thinner than expected. A cross between sweatshirt and T-shirt fabric. I am 5-2” 135lbs and ordered a medium. It fits perfect. I may order another in large just to have that oversized comfy feel. Overall I am happy with this purchase.
734678,"This shirt is not a ladies cut so if you're expecting a fitted/slim cut shirt, this is not that. I think it is a women's cut shirt, but it's a relaxed fit and boxy. Not the style I was looking for but the shirt was a good quality and the printing was done well. Cute, but not for me."
2132000,When an item is called a sweatshirt I expect a much heavier article if clothing! The weight is disappointing - more of a T-shirt material - certainly not a sweatshirt! And the sleeves are a bit too short which makes for a strange fit! I like the length to wear with leggings or skinny jeans. Was wanting what the description said - a sweatshirt - so am disappointed - but kept for warmer weather - still looking for a tunic-type sweatshirt for cold weather!
242979,"It runs small. Order up. The material was disappointing, it looks like t-shirt material. Good for throw me on and go to the store."
962041,That it wasn't a cotton tshirt! You oriental makers don't know Women s sizes in USA.
2110107,Perfect loose comfortable t-shirt.
1393426,I’m really disappointed in the material of this cute shirt cheap flimsy stuff. Use a regular cotton tshirt material that will last.
1872280,Poorly made. & more like a T-Shirt. So angry I spent money on this garbage!
213880,"This did not work as a body shaper. It is a stretchy t-shirt. It did nothing to shape, it only form fit to my existing body shape."
1531143,"Just not great quality. I got the size suggested and it isn’t fitting my bust well. The length isn’t great, the whole thing just leaves something to be desired. Pretty much anything I buy on amazon that’s not a T-shirt or basic clothing item looks cheap"
1318327,If you are looking for a sweatshirt don't buy this as all it is is a long sleeve t-shirt. Well actually I think long sleeve t-shirt are even thicker than this. Not happy with this product whatsoever
1254210,"Cute top but the material is abrasive, causing skin irritation. I recommend wearing a thin t-shirt or a camisole underneath."
908893,"I ordered this shirt in my normal size expecting a regular full length t-shirt to arrive. It's pretty much a crop top. I gave it to my boyfriend's daughter who liked it, but I'm disappointed in the length. Otherwise, it's well made."
1488973,Thin t-shirt material
68668,I ordered an XL because I like my tshirts loose. I typically wear a women’s L. This tshirt is small. It barely fits me and I’m guessing won’t after a few washings. Length is not typical of an XL either. I should have bought two sizes up.
1298624,"Certainly not ""sweatshirt"" material. It's more T-shirt thin. Color was as described."
1029262,This material is as thin as a tshirt.
1920384,"If I could give this zero stars I would. The magnet isn’t even strong enough to hold the two sides together between a piece of cotton T-shirt, let alone skin."
1664497,"I was very disappointed. I should have listened to the other 1-star reviews. The shirt is not flowy as described not does it have a scoop neck. It fit like a regular t-shirt. To add insult to injury, I had to pay for my own shipping to return it."
214191,"Love this shirt! Super soft and has pockets! Nice length, not too long. Thinner than a sweatshirt, but a little thicker than a regular tshirt."
732395,Cool design… shirt material is not your typical t-shirt cotton
1270445,"Color of T-shirt graphic NOT consistent with original; looked very unprofessional. Although shipping label had been issued, product not received by post office for a week. Item was returned the day after being returned and after contacting the company three times, was never contacted by them, or received refund. Do business w/ A&E DESIGNS at your own risk."
727470,"The Tshirt is fine as an item. I ordered the large, however it seems like a medium. I guess I should have ordered extra large."
